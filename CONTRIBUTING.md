# Contributing to TorchLean

Thanks for helping improve TorchLean.
Good contributions usually improve one of four areas:

- make a mathematical definition or theorem clearer,
- add a useful operator, verifier fragment, backend hook, or example,
- improve tests, docs, or website walkthroughs,
- make a trust boundary easier to inspect.

If you are not sure where a change belongs, open an issue or draft PR. Small, concrete PRs are much
easier to review than one large branch that touches every layer at once.

## What Good PRs Look Like

A good TorchLean PR usually has one clear purpose. It might add one operator with its spec and
tests, one theorem with supporting lemmas, one example with a documented command, or one
trust-boundary clarification. Small changes are much easier to review than branches that touch the
API, runtime, proofs, and website at once.

## First Build

TorchLean is pinned by `lean-toolchain`. From a fresh checkout:

```bash
lake update
lake build
lake test
```

Common targets:

```bash
lake build NN.Library
DISABLE_EQUATIONS=1 lake build NN:docs
lake exe verify -- list
```

`import NN` is the everyday user facade. `import NN.Library` is the broad library umbrella for
specs, runtime, verification, and proofs, while still excluding executables and tests.

## Tests, Examples, and Verification

Run the curated test suite:

```bash
lake exe nn_tests_suite
```

Run a few small examples:

```bash
lake env lean --run NN/Examples/Quickstart/TensorBasics.lean
lake env lean --run NN/Examples/Quickstart/AutogradBasics.lean -- --dtype float
lake exe torchlean mlp --cpu --steps 10
```

Run verifier commands:

```bash
lake exe verify -- list
lake exe verify -- torchlean-ibp
```

When you add behavior, add at least one stabilizer: a theorem, a test, a small runnable example, or
a guide/API-doc note. For new operators, examples are useful, but they are not a substitute for the
shared semantics path described below.

## Documentation and Website

The website combines generated API docs, the Verso guide, import/dependency graphs, and a small
Jekyll site.

TorchLean treats generated Lean docs as the primary documentation surface, in the same spirit as
mathlib:

- every `NN/` Lean file should have a module docstring (`/-! ... -/`);
- module docstrings should say what the file defines, name the main declarations, and tell readers
  which import to use;
- public API declarations should have either a direct docstring or `@[inherit_doc ...]`;
- trust/proof status belongs in the module docstring when a file crosses runtime, CUDA, Python,
  certificate, or solver boundaries;
- generated DocGen links should be real links. If dependency pages are pruned from the TorchLean
  site, links to Lean/Std/Mathlib declarations should point to the upstream generated docs.

Build API docs:

```bash
rm -rf .lake/build/doc .lake/build/doc-data .lake/build/api-docs.db
DISABLE_EQUATIONS=1 lake build NN:docs
```

`DISABLE_EQUATIONS=1` keeps DocGen focused on declaration types, docstrings, module docs, source
links, and search data instead of rendering every generated equation lemma from Lean and Mathlib.

Build the Verso guide:

```bash
cd blueprint
lake exe blueprint-gen --output ../_out/blueprint
```

Preview the site locally:

```bash
cd home_page
bundle config set path vendor/bundle
bundle _2.3.14_ install
bundle _2.3.14_ exec jekyll serve --config _config.yml,_config_dev.yml
```

If native Ruby gems fail to build, install your distribution’s Ruby development package and build
tools.

## When A Feature Needs Docs

Most nontrivial TorchLean changes should update more than one surface. Use this map before opening a
PR:

| Change | Documentation surface |
| --- | --- |
| Public API name, trainer option, data loader, or optimizer | declaration docstrings, `NN/API/README.md`, quickstart/example docs if user-facing |
| New runtime backend, CUDA kernel, ATen/libtorch path, or FFI hook | module docstring, `TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md`, CUDA/runtime docs, focused regression check |
| New graph/IR operator | `NN/IR/README.md`, shape/semantics docstrings, runtime/proof/checker coverage note |
| New model-family example | `NN/Examples/Models/.../README.md`, command help, website example page if it is public-facing |
| New verifier or certificate format | `NN/Verification/README.md`, artifact schema docs, example README, trust-boundary note |
| New theorem family | module docstring, `NN/Proofs` or `NN/MLTheory` README, runnable example/checker pointer |
| New dataset or external producer | `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`, data/conversion docs, provenance note |

The goal is not to write marketing copy for every file. The goal is that a reader can answer four
questions without guessing:

- What object is this file about?
- What command or import should I use?
- What is checked or proved?
- Which runtime or external assumptions remain?

Generated pages should be rebuilt from their sources. Do not hand-edit DocGen or Verso output in
`home_page/docs` or `home_page/blueprint`.

## Trust Boundaries

TorchLean keeps three categories separate:

- Lean-checked definitions and theorems,
- executable Lean code and tests,
- external producers or runtimes such as CUDA, Python, solvers, datasets, and generated
  certificates.

When a contribution crosses one of those boundaries, name it plainly. Do not imply that a CUDA
kernel, Python script, checkpoint, dataset, or external certificate producer is trusted merely because
Lean checks the consumer side.

Relevant files:

- `TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md`
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
- `NN/Examples/Verification/*`
- `scripts/verification/*`
- `csrc/cuda/*`

## Adding an Operator

TorchLean's safest extension path starts at the semantics and works outward. Prefer one operator
meaning shared by user code, graph execution, and verification. If an operator is deliberately
runtime-only or checker-only, say so in the file that introduces it.

Typical order:

1. Add the mathematical definition under `NN/Spec/Core/*` or `NN/Spec/Layers/*`.
2. If training or reverse-mode execution needs gradients for the operator, add its forward function
   and VJP contract under `NN/Spec/Autograd/*`.
3. If it is a graph primitive, extend `NN.IR.OpKind` and the denotation in `NN/IR/Semantics.lean`.
4. Update shape inference/checking in `NN/IR/Infer.lean` and related contract files.
5. Add runtime support under `NN/Runtime/*` when execution needs it.
6. If a verifier must reason about the operator, add propagation rules or certificate expectations
   under `NN/Verification/*` or `NN/MLTheory/*`.
7. Add a test or runnable example.

If an operator is intentionally only for execution or only for verification, document that boundary
instead of quietly slipping it into the shared semantics layer.

## Examples

Examples live under `NN/Examples/*`. Most model examples are runnable through:

```bash
lake exe torchlean <example> [args...]
```

Direct Lean examples usually look like:

```bash
lake env lean --run NN/Examples/.../Foo.lean -- [args...]
```

Keep examples small enough to run, but not so artificial that readers cannot tell what they are
learning. If an example needs external data, make the path explicit and keep checked-in fixtures
small.

## Style and Proof Hygiene

TorchLean aims to keep `NN/` free of `sorry`.

```bash
python3 scripts/checks/repo_lint.py
```

Project conventions:

- Prefer small modules with minimal imports.
- Add module docstrings and docstrings for user-facing definitions, structures, and theorems.
- Split expensive proofs into named lemmas instead of relying on huge `simp` or `aesop` calls.
- Keep executable examples and proof code separate when they have different trust assumptions.
- Avoid introducing axioms. If one is unavoidable, quarantine and document it.

## Checking Untrusted Proofs

TorchLean includes a wrapper for `leanprover/comparator`, which can compare a trusted
`Challenge.lean` against an untrusted `Solution.lean` inside a `landrun` sandbox.

Prerequisite:

- Install `landrun` and make sure it is on `PATH`: https://github.com/Zouuup/landrun

Typical workflow:

1. Create a separate small Lake project with `Challenge.lean`, `Solution.lean`, and a comparator
   JSON config.
2. Make that project depend on TorchLean, for example:
   `require TorchLean from "/path/to/TorchLean"`.
3. Run:

```bash
python3 /path/to/TorchLean/scripts/sandbox/run_comparator.py ./config.json --project .
```

See `https://github.com/leanprover/comparator` for the JSON schema and default axiom allowlist
pattern.

## PR Checklist

- `lake build` succeeds from a clean checkout.
- Relevant tests, examples, or theorem checks were added.
- User-facing changes include docstrings and, when useful, guide or website notes.
- Trust boundaries are named rather than hidden.
- No new `sorry` appears in `NN/`.
