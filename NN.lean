# NN

Complete TorchLean umbrella import. Use it when one file spans application code and the proof,
verification, graph, floating-point, widget, or backend subsystems:

```lean
import NN
open TorchLean
```

Application files that only need models, data, and training can use `import NN.API`. The
user-facing names live under the `TorchLean` namespace. Direct subsystem imports such as
`NN.Spec`, `NN.Runtime`, `NN.Proofs`, and `NN.Verification` are available when a file does not need
the full library.
