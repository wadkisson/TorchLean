# Tensor Views (API)

Shape-preserving tensor views that show up across examples and subsystems.

These helpers are model-agnostic:
- they are not tied to a particular layer architecture, and
- they avoid pulling in large "example config" modules just to access a view.

## Flattened Prefix View

For bounded examples, it is often useful to treat an arbitrary `source` shape as a flattened feature
vector and keep only the first `takeDim` coordinates. Runnable examples use this when they need a
small fixed feature vector from a larger tensor.
-/

/--
Flatten each sample in a batch and keep the first `takeDim` entries.

The output is a typed matrix `batch × takeDim`.
