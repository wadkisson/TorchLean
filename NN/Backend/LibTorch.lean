# LibTorch Backend Capsules

Optional LibTorch-backed capsules.

These capsules are intentionally separated from the maintained registry. Adding the module means
accepting an external implementation boundary. The SDPA bridge uses TorchLean's hard boolean-mask
convention and supplies forward values only; TorchLean retains the tape and local backward rule.
