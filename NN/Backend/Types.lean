# Backend Types

Small vocabulary for backend selection and trust boundaries.

TorchLean owns the spec, graph, and proof-facing contracts. Backends are execution providers for
parts of that graph: a Lean reference path, the TorchLean runtime, native CUDA kernels, LibTorch,
ATen, cuBLAS/cuDNN/cuFFT, TPU/XLA, AWS Neuron/Trainium, or future platform-specific providers. This
file deliberately contains only data. It should stay cheap to import from specs, runtime wrappers,
docs generators, and tests.

/-- Stable operation vocabulary used by backend capsules, graph planning, and runtime guards.

This is deliberately a closed vocabulary. New backend-visible operations should be added here and
then wired through the IR adapter and capsule registry. Runtime tape/debug labels may still be
strings, but the backend planner should not accept arbitrary stringly-typed operation names.

How much TorchLean knows about an implementation.

`trustedExternal` is allowed, but it is intentionally loud: the contract names the boundary instead
of silently treating an industrial kernel as though Lean had verified its source.

/--
One policy for the complete assurance boundary of a backend plan.

The first three fields control which implementation trust levels the planner may select. The
remaining fields control which kinds of evidence may discharge the selected capsule's shape,
layout, value, and VJP obligations. Keeping these decisions in one record prevents a profile from
selecting a capsule under one policy and auditing it under a contradictory second policy.

another external implementation. The selected boundary remains visible in the execution audit.
