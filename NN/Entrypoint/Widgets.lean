# Widgets entrypoint

Umbrella import for TorchLean's optional Infoview / widget tooling.

This entrypoint imports the widget implementation modules directly. We avoid a second top-level
`NN.Widgets` alias so the root namespace stays focused on the library umbrella and subsystem
entrypoints.

The entrypoint is editor-facing:

- ordinary runtime/proof files should import the concrete library modules they need;
- tutorial and inspection files can import this one module to get all widget commands;
- adding a widget here does not make it part of TorchLean's trusted semantics.

`NN.Widgets.Interop.PyTorchTranslator` is included here because it is exactly that kind of
editor-side assistant: useful for navigating PyTorch-to-TorchLean workflows, but not a proof that
arbitrary Python has been verified.
