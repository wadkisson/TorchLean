# GraphSpec tutorial

GraphSpec is TorchLean's architecture-facing graph language. It is useful when you want a model to
exist first as a typed graph that can later be interpreted in several ways:

- as a pure specification (`Interp.spec`) for theorem statements,
- as an executable TorchLean program (`Compile.torchProgram`) for direct execution,
- as a sequential `nn.Sequential` view when the graph is just a layer stack, and
- as a DAG model when the architecture has sharing, skip connections, or multi-input nodes.

That is why this folder is not a duplicate of `NN.Spec.Models` or `NN.Examples.Models`.

- `NN.Spec.Models` describes mathematical/reference model semantics.
- `NN.GraphSpec.Models` describes architecture graphs and their parameter ABI.
- `NN.Examples.Models` contains runnable training scripts.

This tutorial does two things:

1. It runs the smallest complete lowering path: `GraphSpec.Models.mlp → ToTorchLean.toSeq →
   train.run`.
2. It typechecks and explains the broader GraphSpec model ladder: MLP, CNN, residual linear block,
   and ResNet18.

Only the MLP is trained here because it is the compact check path for `Seq` lowering. The larger
models are still GraphSpec models; they are deliberately kept as architecture terms so graph passes,
exporters, and proofs can consume them without turning this tutorial into a slow vision benchmark.

Run:

```bash
lake exe torchlean graphspec --backend eager
lake exe torchlean graphspec --backend compiled
```

You can also pass the standard scalar/runtime flags accepted by `train.run`, such as
`--dtype ieee32`.

The smallest sequential GraphSpec model.

Parameter ABI:
`[Mat 3 2, Vec 3, Mat 1 3, Vec 1]`.

/--
A small CNN graph, included here so the tutorial is visibly not “just MLP”.

This is still a sequential graph: convolution, ReLU, pooling, convolution, ReLU, pooling, flatten,
linear head. The ugly-looking type is the point: the parameter shapes and intermediate spatial
arithmetic are checked before the model can be used.

/--
The minimal DAG-native skip-connection example:

`x ↦ relu((W x + b) + x)`.

This cannot be honestly represented as a plain chain without either duplicating the input path or
hiding sharing in a special layer. That is the pedagogical reason `GraphSpec.DAG` exists.

The larger residual-family architecture available from the same model catalog.

We bind it here as a compile-time shape check: users can inspect its type in the editor, while the
runtime tutorial below stays small enough to run instantly.
