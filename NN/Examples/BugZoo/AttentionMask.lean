# BugZoo: attention-mask semantics

Attention code has its own failure modes: mask polarity, head reshaping, Q/K/V layout, and KV-cache
mismatches are easy to get wrong and hard to notice from accuracy tests alone. This file focuses on the
mask part, because TorchLean already has precise theorems for it.

Here is the bug-shaped PyTorch pattern we want to rule out:

```python
# Wrong for causal attention: the polarity is flipped, so future tokens are allowed.
scores = q @ k.transpose(-2, -1) / math.sqrt(d)
mask = torch.triu(torch.ones(T, T, dtype=torch.bool), diagonal=1)
weights = torch.softmax(scores.masked_fill(mask == False, -torch.inf), dim=-1)
```

The intended PyTorch version uses true negative infinity on blocked future entries:

```python
future = torch.triu(torch.ones(T, T, dtype=torch.bool), diagonal=1)
weights = torch.softmax(scores.masked_fill(future, -torch.inf), dim=-1)
assert weights[i, j] == 0.0 for all j > i
```

Lean's ordinary `ℝ` does not contain a literal `-∞`, but mathlib does provide extended reals
`EReal`, where `⊥` is negative infinity and `EReal.exp ⊥ = 0`. We record that exact `-∞` fact
first. TorchLean's ordinary tensor softmax then uses the computationally convenient equivalent:
blocked logits get zero numerator before normalization. Both views lead to the exact theorem below.

For a strict-future position, exact causal masking assigns literal `-∞`.

This is the formal version of the PyTorch operation
`scores.masked_fill(future, -torch.inf)` at one matrix coordinate.

Therefore, the strict-future numerator is exactly zero.

This is why TorchLean's attention spec writes this zero numerator directly.

/--
True-`-∞` causal attention gets the exact zero-weight theorem.

This is the statement we want for formal output-causality arguments: every strict-future key has
zero attention mass for the current query row. In TorchLean this is represented by
`hardMaskedSoftmaxSpec`, not by a finite real sentinel treated as `-∞`.
