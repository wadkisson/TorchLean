# BugZoo: autograd domains before masks

PyTorch's own autograd notes document a sharp footgun: if a program computes `x / 0` and only
masks the bad value afterward, the forward loss can look masked while the backward graph still
contains the undefined division. The documented example gives a `nan` gradient for the masked-out
entry:

https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/main/notes/autograd.html#division-by-zero-in-autograd

TorchLean's useful claim here is the graph-level contract. The safe-domain choice is an explicit
spec node: use `safedivSpec` in the computation that is recorded, then mask or weight the resulting
tensor. Downstream proofs and importers can then see the protected division directly in the graph
shape.

/--
The safe pattern records an epsilon-protected division in the graph before the mask is applied.

This mirrors PyTorch's recommendation to mask before division or otherwise avoid recording an
undefined division. The mask is represented as a numeric weight tensor because this file is about
the algebraic graph boundary, not boolean indexing.

/--
The risky shape of the graph: division is recorded first, and the mask is applied afterward.

This definition records the contrast class. It can still be useful at runtime when a denominator is
externally known to be safe, but that safety is not visible in the graph shape itself.

    {α : Type} [Context α]
    (mask numerator denominator : Spec.Tensor α s) : Spec.Tensor α s :=
  Spec.Tensor.mulSpec mask (Spec.Tensor.divSpec numerator denominator)

/--
The safe-domain contract expands to division by `denominator + epsilon`, followed by the mask.

This is the checked TorchLean hook: downstream proofs and importers can distinguish the protected
graph from the "divide first, mask later" graph.
