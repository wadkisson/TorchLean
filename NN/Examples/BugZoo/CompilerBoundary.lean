# BugZoo: compiler and export semantic mismatches

DL compiler bugs are especially dangerous because they can be silent: the optimized graph runs and
returns a tensor, but its semantics no longer match the source model.

NNSmith is the clean citation for this class. It generates valid neural-network graphs, searches for
inputs that avoid floating-point exceptional values, and differentially tests DL compilers. The
authors report 72 new bugs across TVM, TensorRT, ONNXRuntime, and PyTorch, with 58 confirmed and 51
fixed:

- Liu et al., “NNSmith: Generating Diverse and Valid Test Cases for Deep Learning Compilers”,
  ASPLOS 2023.
  https://doi.org/10.1145/3575693.3575707
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13066

FreeFuzz gives the same warning at the framework/API level: mining real usage snippets found
confirmed PyTorch/TensorFlow library bugs, including backend- and mode-specific failures:

- Wei et al., “Free Lunch for Testing: Fuzzing Deep-Learning Libraries from Open Source”,
  ICSE 2022.
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06589

A 2026 PyTorch-compiler study focuses on the same kind of boundary: silent `torch.compile`
correctness bugs where compiled models return incorrect outputs without an exception or warning:

- Li et al., “Demystifying the Silence of Correctness Bugs in PyTorch Compiler”, 2026.
  https://arxiv.org/abs/2604.08720

TorchLean's answer is a semantic boundary. For the supported IR fragment, successful compilation to
the executable graph should be justified by a theorem that executable evaluation agrees with the
denotational source semantics. External compilers and GPU kernels still need their own conformance
evidence; this file spells out the contract shape so that “we tested it once” is not confused with a
semantic guarantee.

The full TorchLean compiler-correctness chapter contains the stronger IR-specific theorem. This
example stays local so that importing the examples chapter does not force every heavy compiler
proof to elaborate.

/--
The semantic contract at compiler/export/backend boundaries.

`sourceEval` is the reference semantics, `targetEval` is the compiled/exported/backend semantics,
and `preserves` says the target agrees with the source on every input. This compact structure is not a
replacement for the IR-specific compiler proof; it is the reusable shape of the claim that NNSmith-
style and FreeFuzz-style bugs violate.
