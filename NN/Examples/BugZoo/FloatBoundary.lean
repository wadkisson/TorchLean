# BugZoo: floating-point trust boundaries

Floating point is not a cosmetic implementation detail. Robustness and equivalence proofs over real
numbers can become unsound when the deployed network runs with finite precision, fused operations,
different reduction order, denorm/flush behavior, or backend-specific kernels.

The key warning paper is:

- Jia and Rinard, “Exploiting Verified Neural Networks via Floating Point Numerical Error”,
  IEEE S&P Workshops 2020.
  https://doi.org/10.1109/SPW50608.2020.00058

TorchLean's response is not to pretend Lean's runtime `Float32` is transparent. It is opaque to the
Lean kernel. So we expose the trust boundary as a typeclass: if the runtime `Float32` primitive
matches the bit-level `IEEE32Exec` operation, we may rewrite runtime arithmetic into the executable
IEEE-754 model and then use the internal floating-point theorems.

This file focuses on the boundary because the important part is the boundary itself. The theorem below
says: once the runtime assumption is supplied, ordinary runtime addition is reduced to the explicit
bit-level `IEEE32Exec.add` operation.

/--
Runtime `Float32` addition rewrites to the explicit bit-level IEEE executor only under the named
runtime-conformance assumption.

Floating-point deployment semantics are either modeled by `IEEE32Exec` or isolated as a trust
obligation.
