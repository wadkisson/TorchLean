# Deep Dives

This folder contains examples for readers who already know the quickstart path and want to inspect
TorchLean's internal boundaries more carefully. The files are small, concrete tours of the layers
underneath the public trainer: float semantics, GraphSpec lowering, IR shape behavior, widgets,
PyTorch export, and the shared graph/checker story.

Build the whole slice with:

```bash
lake build NN.Examples.DeepDives
```

## Files

| File | Command or action | What it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Tensors/Basic.lean` | build as part of `NN.Examples.DeepDives` | Tensor construction, indexing, shapes, and low-level tensor vocabulary. |
| `Floats/Float32Modes.lean` | `lake exe torchlean float32_modes` | Difference between ideal values, proof-oriented float models, executable IEEE behavior, and runtime Float32 paths. |
| `Floats/ArbIEEEExecCompare.lean` | `lake exe torchlean floats_arb_ieee_compare` | Arb/python-flint interval evidence compared with TorchLean's executable IEEE32 path. |
| `GraphSpec/Tutorial.lean` | `lake exe torchlean graphspec` | Authoring a small graph-style architecture and lowering it into the public trainer path. |
| `IRAxisOps.lean` | `lake exe torchlean ir_axis_ops` | Axis operations in the op-tagged IR: reductions, broadcasts, shape changes, and evaluator behavior. |
| `TorchIRPyTorch.lean` | `lake exe torchlean torch_ir_pytorch --arch mlp > exported_model.py` | Emitting readable PyTorch code from a TorchLean IR graph and payload shape. |
| `OneSemanticUniverse.lean` | `lake exe torchlean one_semantic_universe --samples 50` | One IR graph interpreted through execution, interval bounds, and checker-facing semantics. |
| `Widgets.lean` | open in an editor with the Lean infoview | Tensor, graph, Float32, CROWN, autograd, training, and runtime-context widgets. |

## How To Read This Folder

Each file isolates one boundary:

- `Floats/` distinguishes Lean-defined executable IEEE behavior from rounded-real proof models and
  external Arb oracle evidence.
- `GraphSpec/` shows architecture-level graph authoring before runtime execution.
- `IRAxisOps.lean` and `TorchIRPyTorch.lean` show the lower-level IR artifact that exporters,
  widgets, and verifiers inspect.
- `OneSemanticUniverse.lean` ties a single graph to multiple semantic views, making clear which
  objects are executable checks and which objects are Lean statements.
- `Widgets.lean` renders Lean objects for human inspection without making the widget output a proof.

Reusable algorithms should not live here. If a deep dive grows into an API, move the reusable part
under `NN/Spec`, `NN/Runtime`, `NN/IR`, `NN/Verification`, or `NN/MLTheory`, then keep the example
as a small tour of that API.
