# DQN Replay Mini-Example

This example runs the runtime pieces used by an off-policy DQN-style update:

1. construct typed transitions;
2. insert them into a bounded replay buffer;
3. sample a minibatch;
4. evaluate a DQN minibatch loss from caller-provided online/target Q-functions.

The Q-functions are hand-written closures rather than neural networks, so the example stays focused
on replay buffers and minibatch losses. A full trainable DQN run can later swap those closures for
compiled TorchLean models and an optimizer step.

Run from the repo root through the maintained example runner:

```bash
lake exe torchlean dqn_replay
```
