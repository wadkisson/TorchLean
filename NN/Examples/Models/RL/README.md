# Reinforcement-Learning Model Examples

This folder contains runnable RL commands selected through `lake exe torchlean ...`. The examples
exercise TorchLean's actor/critic models, PPO/DQN helper code, rollout data, Gymnasium boundary,
Lean-native environments, CUDA runtime, and widget-friendly artifacts.

The companion viewer files live in `NN/Examples/RL/`. Pure RL specs live in `NN/Spec/RL/`, runtime
sessions live in `NN/Runtime/RL/`, and proof hooks live in `NN/Proofs/RL/`.

## Files

- `PPOGridWorld.lean`: PPO on a Lean-native GridWorld. Even though the environment is Lean code,
  transitions are still checked through the same boundary shape used by external environments.
- `PPOCartPole.lean`: PPO on external Gymnasium `CartPole-v1`, with every step checked before it is
  consumed as training data.
- `PPOPongRam.lean`: optional ALE/Gymnasium Pong RAM path. This depends on external `ale-py` and is
  not part of the default quick-check tier.
- `DQNReplay.lean`: small replay-buffer and DQN minibatch-loss example using hand-written Q
  functions rather than a full trainable neural DQN.

## Commands

Lean-native GridWorld:

```bash
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean ppo_gridworld --device cuda \
  --updates 1 --eval-every 1 --eval-episodes 1 --eval-max-steps 8
```

Gymnasium CartPole:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user 'gymnasium>=1.0'
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean ppo_cartpole --device cuda \
  --updates 1 --eval-every 1 --eval-episodes 1 --eval-max-steps 8
```

DQN replay mini-example:

```bash
lake exe torchlean dqn_replay
```

Optional Pong RAM path:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user 'gymnasium>=1.0' ale-py
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean ppo_pong_ram --device cuda --updates 1
```

## Artifacts

PPO commands write JSON artifacts under `data/rl/` by default: training logs, policies, and episode
paths. Open the viewer files in `NN/Examples/RL/` to inspect them in the Lean infoview.

## What Is Checked

The RL examples are executable algorithm examples with formal hooks. The checked surface is the
environment/rollout boundary and the Lean-native MDP structure that downstream code consumes:

- Gymnasium observations, rewards, actions, and done flags are checked before entering the typed
  rollout stream.
- Lean-native GridWorld also goes through the boundary checker so downstream code sees one data
  shape.
- MDP and boundary facts live in `NN/Spec/RL` and `NN/Proofs/RL`.

That separation lets the same rollout data be used for runtime training, widget inspection, and
future theorem statements. External simulators stay named producers; TorchLean owns the typed
rollout records, boundary checks, Lean-native environment specs, and proof hooks built on top of
those records.
