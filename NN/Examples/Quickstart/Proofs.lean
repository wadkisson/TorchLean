# Quickstart: Proving Small TorchLean Facts

TorchLean examples are not only executable scripts. Many guarantees are ordinary Lean theorems:
shape round-trips, typed tensor construction, activation identities, and later full verification
statements.

The boundary where TorchLean becomes more than an executable ML library is:

- compile-time guarantees from shape-indexed tensor types, and
- ordinary mathematical lemmas about the public API.

The deeper proof libraries live under `NN.Proofs.*`, `NN.Verification.*`, and `NN.MLTheory.*`.

A tensor's shape is part of its type.

If this definition compiles, Lean has already checked that the literal has exactly two entries and
therefore really is a `Vec 2`. The commented shape-mismatch below is the kind of bug Lean catches
before runtime:

```lean
-- def badVector : Tensor Float (shape![3]) := tensor! [1.0, 2.0]
```
-/
def twoVector : Tensor.T Float (shape![2]) :=
  tensor! [1.0, 2.0]

/--
Runtime dimension lists can still be related back to static TorchLean shapes.

This is the compact theorem behind many JSON/CLI/data-loader paths: parse dimensions dynamically,
then recover the precise `Shape` used by the typed tensor API.

theorem matrix_shape_roundtrip :
    Shape.ofDims (Shape.toList (shape![2, 3])) = shape![2, 3] := by
  simp

/--
The host-side public ReLU agrees with the usual mathematical identity on nonnegative real inputs.

This is deliberately a compact theorem, but it has the same form as larger library facts: state the
semantic contract once, prove it in Lean, and use it downstream without trusting comments or tests.
-/
theorem relu_eq_self_of_nonnegative (x : ℝ) (hx : 0 ≤ x) :
    TorchLean.Semantics.relu x = x := by
  unfold TorchLean.Semantics.relu
  exact max_eq_left hx

/-- ReLU clamps nonpositive real inputs to zero. -/
theorem relu_eq_zero_of_nonpositive (x : ℝ) (hx : x ≤ 0) :
    TorchLean.Semantics.relu x = 0 := by
  unfold TorchLean.Semantics.relu
  exact max_eq_right hx

/--
Concrete examples can also be proven by simplification.

This is often enough for small API examples where the point is to show the proof shape without
introducing a larger mathematical development.

example : TorchLean.Semantics.relu (3 : ℝ) = 3 := by
  exact relu_eq_self_of_nonnegative 3 (by norm_num)

  exact relu_eq_zero_of_nonpositive (-2) (by norm_num)
