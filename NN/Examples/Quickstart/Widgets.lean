# Quickstart: Widgets

TorchLean widgets are editor-side inspection tools. They are not part of the runtime semantics and
they do not change proofs; they simply render the values you already have in Lean.

Try these commands in the editor:

- put the cursor on a `#tensor_view`, `#float32_view`, `#ir_view`, or `#train_log_view` command;
- put the cursor on `#pytorch_translate_file` to preview a PyTorch-to-TorchLean skeleton;
- Lean's infoview renders an interactive panel;
- if you want the full gallery, open `NN.Examples.Advanced.Widgets`.

This quickstart keeps only the smallest useful examples; the full widget gallery lives in
`NN.Examples.Advanced.Widgets`.

The commands below are ordinary Lean commands that render editor panels through ProofWidgets. They
do not alter the definitions above and they are not part of any proof. This is why widgets are safe
to keep in introductory examples: deleting the commands leaves the same tensors, graphs, logs, and
Python source files behind.

The translator widget is placed next to the IR/shape widgets. It is a bounded-scope
preview for "what would this PyTorch layer stack look like in TorchLean?" The checked graph-capture
path is still the `torch.export` importer, which parses and validates explicit IR JSON.
