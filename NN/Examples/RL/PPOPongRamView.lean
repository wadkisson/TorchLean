# PPO Atari Pong RAM Artifacts

This file visualizes the training curve produced by the optional Pong RAM PPO module in
`NN/Examples/Models/RL/PPOPongRam.lean`.

Pong RAM uses the same Gymnasium boundary as CartPole, with ALE registration and a
higher-dimensional observation. The viewer focuses on saved-artifact inspection for the Atari RAM
path rather than benchmark-specific PPO tuning.

Dependency setup for the optional ALE path:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user 'gymnasium>=1.0' ale-py
```

After producing a log, put the cursor on the command below in an editor. The infoview will render
the saved log.

Notes:
- The executable writes `data/rl/ppo_pong_ram_trainlog.json` by default (override with `--log`).
- This viewer is pure: if the file is missing, it shows an error panel instead of failing to build.
