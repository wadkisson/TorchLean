# VNN-COMP-Style MNIST-FC Artifacts

This folder documents TorchLean's current VNN-COMP-facing shape: exported JSON artifacts for a
small MNIST fully-connected benchmark family, checked by Lean through
`NN.Verification.VNNComp.MnistFC`.

The goal is not to mirror the whole VNN-COMP infrastructure inside the repository. VNN-COMP uses
standard benchmark packages, network formats, property files, timeouts, and solver reporting rules.
TorchLean's current entry point is narrower and more formalization-friendly: convert the benchmark
instance into explicit JSON objects, then run a Lean side checker over the exported weights,
properties, and optional verifier metadata.

Expected local layout:

```text
_external/vnncomp/mnist_fc/model_weights.json
_external/vnncomp/mnist_fc/suite.json
_external/vnncomp/mnist_fc/alphas_crownobj.json   # optional
```

Run with:

```bash
lake exe verify -- vnncomp-mnistfc \
  --weights=_external/vnncomp/mnist_fc/model_weights.json \
  --suite=_external/vnncomp/mnist_fc/suite.json \
  --max=2
```

If the artifacts live somewhere else, pass `--weights=...`, `--suite=...`, and optionally
`--alphas=...`.

The checked object is the exported suite item: network weights, input region, expected label or
margin property, and any optional bound data attached to the item. The external preparation step is
responsible for converting the original benchmark files into this JSON shape. Full benchmark dumps,
large model files, and solver outputs belong in `_external/` or another local data directory rather
than in git.

The long-term direction is a native Lean verifier path that can read standard benchmark objects
more directly. This example is the small, reviewable bridge: VNN-COMP-style problem data enters
TorchLean as explicit artifacts, and Lean checks the part of the property represented in those
artifacts.
