# `NN.Floats.Arb`

Umbrella import for the Arb (ball arithmetic) oracle integration.

This is an **external** backend (python-flint / Arb/FLINT) called via `IO.Process`.
It is useful for:

- rigorous enclosures of real-valued expressions (ball arithmetic),
- tight bounds for monotone nonlinearities,
- cross-checking TorchLean’s native float backends (`IEEE32Exec`, `FP32`/`NF`).

Trust boundary: the Python/Arb toolchain is an oracle. This module parses and packages its output; it
does not by itself prove the Arb enclosure certificate inside Lean.
