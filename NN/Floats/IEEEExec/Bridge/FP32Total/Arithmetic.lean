# Total FP32 Bridge: Arithmetic

This module lifts the finite `FP32` refinement results for addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and square root to the total `IEEE32Exec` domain. A theorem either recovers the rounded
real equation from a finite executable result or leaves the NaN/infinity branch visible through
`toReal?`.

See `FP32Total.Core` for the finite/special-value split and references.
