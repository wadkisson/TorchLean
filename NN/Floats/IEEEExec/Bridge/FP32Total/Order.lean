# Total FP32 Bridge: Ordering

This module relates executable IEEE comparisons to real order when the operands are finite. It
keeps unordered NaN cases explicit rather than coercing every bit pattern into `ℝ`; signed zeros,
which have distinct encodings but equal real values, are handled by the IEEE comparison rules.

See `FP32Total.Core` for the total bridge convention and references.
