# `NN/Floats/IEEEExec`: Executable IEEE-754 Float32 Semantics

This directory contains TorchLean's Lean defined executable model of IEEE-754 binary32. It also holds
bridge theorems that connect runtime execution to proof oriented rounding models over `ℝ`.

## What Lives Here

- `Exec32.lean` and `Exec32/`: the executable kernel (`IEEE32Exec`), bit layout, arithmetic,
  comparison, directed rounding, dyadic conversion, exception-status outcomes, instances, and
  deterministic transcendental wrappers.
- `Encoding/`: interpretation of bit patterns as exact dyadics and reals, together with sign-bit
  facts.
- `Rounding/`: integer and rational lemmas used to prove the executable rounding algorithms.
- `Semantics/`: real and `EReal` interpretations, error bounds, and operation sandwiches.
- `Rules/`: proved rules for special values and the deterministic transcendental wrappers.
- `Reductions.lean`: reduction semantics for sums/dot products.
- `Bridge/`: refinement from executable bits to rounded-real, extended-real, expression, and
  runtime models.

## Interval / Directed Rounding Semantics

If your goal is interval arithmetic over float32, this folder provides the directed rounding
kernels and their soundness proofs:

- `DirectedRoundingSoundness/`: soundness of directed dyadic and rational rounding and the
  endpoint operations for addition, multiplication, fused multiply-add, division, and square
  root. The statements use `EReal`, so endpoint overflow to `±∞` remains a valid enclosure.
- `Semantics/MinMaxERealSoundness.lean`: order lemmas used by endpoint min/max rules.

The interval *API layer* that uses these results lives in `NN/Floats/Interval/`.

## Bridge To Proof Oriented Float Models

TorchLean keeps two float32 views:

- Executable (`IEEE32Exec`): what we can run inside Lean, with bit level semantics.
- Proof oriented (`FP32`): round on real semantics used for numerical error envelopes.

Bridge files connect these on the finite, no overflow path:

- `Bridge/FP32.lean` and `Bridge/FP32/`: per-operation refinement lemmas on the finite branch,
  including dyadic/rational rounding infrastructure.
- `Bridge/Expressions.lean`: expression-level refinement that composes operation lemmas once.
- `Bridge/FP32Total.lean`: packages finite refinement and proved special-value rules using
  `toReal?`.
- `Bridge/ERealTotal.lean`: an `EReal` interpretation that distinguishes `+∞` and `-∞` while
  representing NaN as `none`.
- `Bridge/RuntimeFloat32.lean`: an assumption-based interface relating Lean runtime `Float32` to
  `IEEE32Exec`. The runtime is opaque to the kernel, so this cannot be proved internally.

## How To Use It

Use `IEEE32Exec` when the object you need is executable binary32 inside Lean. Use `FP32` when the
theorem should be a rounded-real error statement. Use runtime `Float32` or CUDA only with an
explicit bridge or trust-boundary statement.

The value-only operations (`add`, `mul`, `div`, `fma`, and `sqrt`) are accompanied by
status-bearing operations (`addWithStatus`, `mulWithStatus`, `divWithStatus`, `fmaWithStatus`, and
`sqrtWithStatus`). An `IEEEOutcome` contains the computed bits and an `IEEEStatus` containing the
invalid, divide-by-zero, overflow, underflow, and inexact indicators. Tininess is detected after
rounding, and underflow implies inexactness by theorem. `Rules/SpecialRules.lean` proves the main
special-value status cases.

The useful proof shape is:

```text
IEEE32Exec operation
  -> finite/no-overflow bridge
  -> FP32 rounded-real statement
  -> real-valued error envelope or interval claim
```

## Trust boundary (important)

IEEE-754 does not specify bit level results for transcendentals (`expf`, `logf`, ...), and platform
libm implementations can differ. TorchLean therefore treats:

- core arithmetic (add/mul/div/sqrt, specials) as the proved executable kernel, and
- transcendentals as deterministic but not IEEE specified unless you use a separate rigorous
  backend (e.g. the Arb oracle under `NN/Floats/Arb/` and the interval glue in `NN/Floats/Interval/`).

`Rules/TranscendentalRules.lean` defines `UnaryApproximationContract` for connecting a finite
executable implementation to a real function on a stated domain with a stated error tolerance.
This contract does not assert that the current deterministic wrappers satisfy a particular
accuracy bound; such a theorem needs evidence for the chosen implementation.
