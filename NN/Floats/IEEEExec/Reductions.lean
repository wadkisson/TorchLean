# Reductions

Deployment-aware reduction semantics for `IEEE32Exec`.

In deployed environments, reductions (sums / dot-products / matmul accumulations) may be evaluated
using different valid parenthesizations and, depending on the implementation, different leaf
orders. Since floating-point addition is not associative, distinct reduction schedules can produce
distinct results.

This module models a reduction as "any result produced by a valid reduction tree over the same
leaves" and proves a standard forward-error enclosure that holds uniformly over all such trees.

### What this file proves

Assuming a local rounded-addition model with parameter `u`, we derive a global enclosure whose
parameters depend only on:

- `n` (the number of leaves), and
- `A = Σ |leaf_i|` (a scale factor).

This matches the standard "γ_k-style" summation bounds where order-dependence is absorbed by `A`
(sum of absolute values) and a growth factor in `n`.

For `IEEE32Exec`, we connect the executable `add` to the real model `fp32Round (a + b)`, but only on
the *finite* branch. If `Inf`/`NaN`/overflow is possible, the right semantics is the special-value
semantics from `SpecialRules.lean`, so this file keeps those cases out of scope via `FiniteEval*`.

### Inspiration and related work

This is a direct formalization of standard numerical-analysis results for parallel sums:

- David Goldberg, “What Every Computer Scientist Should Know About Floating-Point Arithmetic”
  (1991). DOI: 10.1145/103162.103163
- Nicholas J. Higham, *Accuracy and Stability of Numerical Algorithms*, 2nd ed., SIAM (2002),
  especially the summation chapter and the `γ_k`-style bounds.
- Sylvie Boldo and Guillaume Melquiond, “Flocq: A Unified Library for Proving Floating-Point
  Algorithms in Coq” (ARITH 2011). DOI: 10.1109/ARITH.2011.40

Instead of bounding nondeterminism, another design direction is to eliminate it via reproducible
accumulators/binned sums. That literature is a complement to this file:

  Point Summation” (ACM TOMS 2020). DOI: 10.1145/3389360

A binary reduction schedule.

Leaves contain inputs of type `α`; internal nodes indicate “evaluate left and right subtrees, then
combine”. Different trees represent different valid parenthesizations for a parallel reduction.

The leaves of the reduction tree, read left-to-right.

We use `List.Perm` on `leaves` later to model “the same multiset of inputs, possibly reordered by
parallel scheduling”.

Monotonicity of the growth factor in the number of leaves.

When `u ≥ 0` (which is the only meaningful regime for an error parameter), longer reductions have

/--
Evaluate a reduction tree using a given “rounded add” at internal nodes.

`evalRound roundAdd leafVal t` maps leaves via `leafVal`, and combines subresults using
`roundAdd`. This abstracts the idea of evaluating a parallel sum with a fixed local rounding model.

Sum of absolute values of leaf contributions.

This is the standard “scale” that appears in forward-error bounds for floating-point reductions.

Triangle-inequality bound: the absolute value of the exact sum is at most the sum of absolute
values.

This is the standard inequality `|Σ a_i| ≤ Σ |a_i|` proved by induction on the tree shape.

Local rounded-addition assumption for reductions.

This matches the usual “unit roundoff” envelope:
`roundAdd a b = (a+b) + e`, with `|e| ≤ u*(|a|+|b|)`.

/--
Order-independent enclosure for any reduction tree evaluated with `roundAdd`.

Let `A = Σ |leaf_i|` be the sum of absolute values of leaves.
For `n` leaves, the rounded evaluation is within `(growth u n - 1) * A` of the exact real sum.

/-! ## `IEEE32Exec`: evaluation + nondeterminism (expression tree + permutation) -/

namespace IEEE32Exec

noncomputable section

/--
Evaluate a reduction tree using the executable `IEEE32Exec.add`.

This is the “concrete” semantics: it includes IEEE special values, finite rounding, etc.
For error analysis we will separately define a real-valued interpretation (`evalRealIEEE`).
-/
def evalIEEE : SumTree IEEE32Exec → IEEE32Exec
  | .leaf x => x
  | .node a b => add (evalIEEE a) (evalIEEE b)

/--
`FiniteEvalSumTree t` means:

- every leaf is finite, and
- every internal `add` evaluates on the finite branch (no `Inf`/`NaN` result).

We need this hypothesis when relating the executable semantics to the real model
`fp32Round (toReal a + toReal b)`: if an `add` can overflow to `Inf` or produce a NaN, the correct
semantic layer is the special-value one from `SpecialRules.lean`, not a small-error enclosure.

  | .leaf x => isFinite x = true
  | .node a b =>
      FiniteEvalSumTree a ∧ FiniteEvalSumTree b ∧ isFinite (add (evalIEEE a) (evalIEEE b)) = true

/--
If the whole reduction evaluates on the finite branch, then the final result is finite.
-/
theorem isFinite_evalIEEE_of_FiniteEvalSumTree :
    ∀ t : SumTree IEEE32Exec, FiniteEvalSumTree t → isFinite (evalIEEE t) = true
  | .leaf x, hx => by simpa [evalIEEE, FiniteEvalSumTree] using hx
  | .node a b, hx => by simpa [evalIEEE] using hx.2.2

/--
Nondeterministic sum result relation.

`sumTreeResult xs r` means: there exists a reduction tree `t` whose leaves are a permutation of `xs`
and such that evaluating `t` using executable `add` produces `r` *and* stays finite throughout.
-/
def sumTreeResult (xs : List IEEE32Exec) (r : IEEE32Exec) : Prop :=
  ∃ t : SumTree IEEE32Exec, List.Perm t.leaves xs ∧ evalIEEE t = r ∧ FiniteEvalSumTree t

/--
Real-valued “finite-branch model” of `evalIEEE`.

Every internal node uses `fp32Round (a+b)`. This is the usual floating-point model
  (round-to-nearest)
*when the result stays finite*; our bridge lemmas justify this model under `FiniteEvalSumTree`.

/--
Under `FiniteEvalSumTree`, the decoded executable sum agrees with the real-valued rounding model.

Informal: as long as all intermediate `add`s stay finite, `IEEE32Exec.add` refines
`fp32Round (toReal a + toReal b)` at each node, so the whole tree refines `evalRealIEEE`.

Enclosure theorem for nondeterministic FP32 sums.

`sumTreeResult xs r` means: `r` is the result of adding the elements of `xs` using executable
`IEEE32Exec.add`, but with an evaluation order that is allowed to vary (a reduction tree plus a
permutation of leaves).

The conclusion produces a witness tree `t` and a bound on how far `toReal r` can deviate from the
exact real sum of `t`’s leaves (measured against the leaf scale `sumAbsIEEE t`).

## Dot-product accumulation (sum of products)

This section models the shape of computations like:

- dot products `Σᵢ xᵢ * yᵢ`, and
- the inner accumulations that show up in `matmul` / conv / attention scores.

On real hardware, the *sum* part is where a lot of nondeterminism creeps in:
threads compute partial sums and then reduce them with a tree-shaped schedule. Different valid
schedules correspond to different parenthesizations and different orders of the same leaf terms.

We model that explicitly:

- leaves are pairs `(x, y)`, interpreted as the executable product `mul x y`,
- internal nodes add those products using executable `add`.

Two important notes (to avoid over-claiming):

1) Our enclosure bounds the *accumulation* error (the rounded adds) relative to the real
   sum of the **already-rounded** products `toReal (mul x y)`. If you want a bound relative to the
   exact real dot product `Σᵢ (toReal xᵢ) * (toReal yᵢ)`, you also need a per-product error bound
     for
   `mul` (provided elsewhere).
2) Some runtimes use fused multiply-add (FMA) for dot products. `IEEE32Exec` has an `fma`, but this
   particular model uses the more basic “mul then add” semantics.

### Executable semantics

`evalDotIEEE` is the concrete reduction semantics: it returns an `IEEE32Exec` result and therefore
includes all IEEE special-value behavior and rounding.
-/

/--
Evaluate a dot-product reduction tree using executable `mul` at leaves and `add` at internal nodes.

This is the “concrete” semantics of a sum-of-products accumulation.
-/
def evalDotIEEE : SumTree (IEEE32Exec × IEEE32Exec) → IEEE32Exec
  | .leaf (x, y) => mul x y
  | .node a b => add (evalDotIEEE a) (evalDotIEEE b)

/--
`FiniteEvalDot t` means:

- each leaf product `mul x y` is finite, and
- each internal accumulation `add` stays finite.

This is the exact analogue of `FiniteEvalSumTree`, but for the sum-of-products setting. We need it
whenever we want to interpret an executable dot-product accumulation as “a real sum + small rounded
add errors”.
-/
def FiniteEvalDot : SumTree (IEEE32Exec × IEEE32Exec) → Prop
  | .leaf (x, y) => isFinite (mul x y) = true
  | .node a b =>
      FiniteEvalDot a ∧ FiniteEvalDot b ∧ isFinite (add (evalDotIEEE a) (evalDotIEEE b)) = true

/-- If a dot-product reduction stays finite at every step, then the final result is finite. -/

    ∀ t : SumTree (IEEE32Exec × IEEE32Exec), FiniteEvalDot t → isFinite (evalDotIEEE t) = true
  | .leaf _, hx => by simpa [evalDotIEEE, FiniteEvalDot] using hx
  | .node a b, hx => by simpa [evalDotIEEE] using hx.2.2

/--
Nondeterministic dot-product result relation.

`dotTreeResult xs r` means: there exists a reduction tree over leaf pairs in `xs` (up to
  permutation)
whose executable evaluation `evalDotIEEE` yields `r` and stays finite throughout.
-/
def dotTreeResult (xs : List (IEEE32Exec × IEEE32Exec)) (r : IEEE32Exec) : Prop :=
  ∃ t : SumTree (IEEE32Exec × IEEE32Exec),
    List.Perm t.leaves xs ∧ evalDotIEEE t = r ∧ FiniteEvalDot t

/--
Real-valued finite-branch model of `evalDotIEEE`.

- Leaves contribute `toReal (mul x y)` (the real meaning of the executable product).
- Internal nodes add those contributions using `fp32Round (a+b)`.

This matches the standard floating-point model for accumulation, under `FiniteEvalDot`.
-/
def evalRealDotIEEE (t : SumTree (IEEE32Exec × IEEE32Exec)) : ℝ :=
  evalRound (fun a b => fp32Round (a + b)) (fun p => toReal (mul p.1 p.2)) t

/--
Exact real sum of the rounded leaf products.

This is *not* the exact real dot product of the original inputs; it is the exact sum of the values
that `evalDotIEEE` would compute at the leaves (after `mul` rounding), ignoring only the rounding
introduced by the accumulation adds.

  exactSum (fun p => toReal (mul p.1 p.2)) t

Leaf scale for dot-product accumulation: `Σ |toReal (mul x y)|`.

This is the “A” term that appears in the forward-error bound for reductions.

  sumAbs (fun p => toReal (mul p.1 p.2)) t

Enclosure theorem for nondeterministic dot-product accumulation.

`dotTreeResult xs r` means: the runtime computed `r` by taking the list of pairs `xs`, multiplying
each pair, and then summing the products using *some* reduction tree whose leaves are a permutation
of `xs`.

The conclusion gives a witness tree `t` for that schedule and an order-independent enclosure:
the accumulation result is close (in `ℝ`) to the exact sum of leaf products, with the same growth
factor bound as in the plain-sum case.
