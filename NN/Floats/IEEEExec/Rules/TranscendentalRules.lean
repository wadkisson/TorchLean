## Deterministic transcendental functions (`exp`, `log`, `tanh`, `sinh`, `cosh`)

IEEE-754 fixes the representation and the basic arithmetic operations, but it does **not** mandate
exact bit-level behavior for transcendental functions like `exp` and `log`. In practice, libraries
(`libm`, SVML, CUDA math, etc.) make slightly different choices, and results can differ across
platforms.

In TorchLean, we still need executable transcendental operations in some examples and runtime
experiments. So we give `IEEE32Exec` *deterministic* definitions for a small set of functions using
fixed algorithms:

- `exp`: range reduction + a fixed-point polynomial for `2^(x/ln 2)`,
- `log`: normalization `x = m * 2^k` + a convergent atanh-series for `log m`,
- `sinh`, `cosh`: defined via `exp`,
- `tanh`: a numerically stable expression in terms of `exp`.

Here we prove the **special-value rules** for those definitions: how NaNs, infinities, signed
zeros (`+0` and `-0`), and sign checks behave. These are the facts we want in proofs without
  unfolding the full fixed-point
implementations.

We do *not* claim that the finite-value approximations match any particular hardware `expf`/`logf`;
the Lean definitions prioritize reproducibility and well-defined behavior.

## Finite approximation contracts

The deterministic functions in this module have proved special-value behavior below. A numerical
accuracy claim on finite inputs requires a separate contract. Keeping that evidence explicit
prevents reproducible execution from being mistaken for correct rounding.

/--
A uniform real-error contract for an executable unary binary32 operation on a stated domain.

For every finite input whose real value lies in `domain`, the executable result must also be finite
and differ from `spec` by at most `tolerance`.

## `exp`

Special values we follow (common libm / PyTorch behavior):

- `exp(NaN) = NaN` (we quiet signaling NaNs),
- `exp(+Inf) = +Inf`,
- `exp(-Inf) = +0`.

For finite inputs, `Exec32.lean` defines a deterministic approximation. These lemmas only expose
the early "special-case" branches, so proofs do not have to unfold the fixed-point core.

## `log`

The special cases match the usual real-analytic extension used by common libraries:

- `log(NaN) = NaN` (quieted),
- `log(+Inf) = +Inf`,
- `log(0) = -Inf` (for both `+0` and `-0`),
- `log(x < 0) = NaN` (including `log(-Inf)`).

PyTorch follows these conventions on IEEE hardware; we mirror them in `IEEE32Exec.log`.

`log` returns `canonicalNaN` on negative finite inputs (domain error).

This captures the standard real domain restriction `log : (0, +∞) → ℝ`, transported to the float32
setting (excluding NaNs/Infs/zeros which are handled by earlier branches).

## `tanh`

Special values we follow:

- `tanh(NaN) = NaN` (quieted),
- `tanh(+Inf) = +1`,
- `tanh(-Inf) = -1`.

The bit patterns used below are the IEEE-754 binary32 encodings of `+1.0f` and `-1.0f`:

- `0x3F800000` = `+1`,
- `0xBF800000` = `-1`.

## `sinh` / `cosh`

These are defined in `Exec32.lean` in terms of `exp` (with a NaN short-circuit up front), so the
special cases are the familiar ones:

- propagate NaNs (quieted),
- `sinh(±Inf) = ±Inf`,
- `cosh(±Inf) = +Inf`.
