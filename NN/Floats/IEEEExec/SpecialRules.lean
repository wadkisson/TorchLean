# Special-value rules for `IEEE32Exec`

`IEEE32Exec` is the executable, proof-relevant bit-level IEEE-754 binary32 kernel. The operations
are defined by case splits (`chooseNaN2`/`chooseNaN3`, Inf rules, then exact+rounded finite core).

We collect the "special-value" part of those definitions as reusable theorems: how NaNs (including
payload selection/quieting) and infinities propagate.

These lemmas are *fully proved* in Lean because they are consequences of the executable definitions
in `NN/Floats/IEEEExec/Exec32.lean`.

Why keep these lemmas in a separate file?

- The executable definitions in `Exec32.lean` are necessarily a bit long: they split on NaN/Inf/0
  cases, decode to exact intermediates, and then round back to float32.
- In proofs (and in higher-level specs), we usually want to *use* those definitions without
  unfolding them over and over. The lemmas here are the small, reliable rewrite rules we reach for.

## Binary32 reminder (math we use repeatedly)

IEEE-754 binary32 is stored as a 32-bit word split into fields:

- 1 sign bit,
- 8 exponent bits,
- 23 fraction ("mantissa") bits.

If we write `e` for the exponent field and `f` for the fraction field, then:

- `x` is **finite**  iff `e ≠ 255`,
- `x` is `±∞`        iff `e = 255 ∧ f = 0`,
- `x` is a **NaN**   iff `e = 255 ∧ f ≠ 0`.

`isFinite`, `isInf`, and `isNaN` in `Exec32.lean` are just executable versions of those predicates.

Finally, a **signaling NaN** is a NaN whose fraction's designated “quiet bit” is *not* set.
Our `quietNaN` turns any NaN into a quiet NaN by setting that one bit, leaving the exponent field
unchanged.

## "Choosing a NaN" always yields a non-finite result

The `chooseNaN*` helpers return a NaN operand (quieted). This makes it easy to prove that "once a
NaN is selected, the result is not finite" without redoing bitfield reasoning at every call site.
-/

/--
If `chooseNaN1 x = some nan`, then `nan` is not finite.

Mathematically: `chooseNaN1` only returns `some _` when `x` is a NaN, and in that case it returns
`quietNaN x`. Quieting sets a fraction bit but keeps the exponent field equal to all ones, so the
result is not finite.

NaN value at the bit level (exponent field is all ones), hence not finite.

## NaN selection rules (`chooseNaN2` / `chooseNaN3`)

These are "one-step" lemmas for the NaN-selection helpers themselves. They let you prove facts
about `chooseNaN2`/`chooseNaN3` without unfolding their nested `if` chains.

### What `chooseNaN*` does (informal spec)

Both helpers implement the NaN-propagation part of IEEE-754-style arithmetic:

- If any operand is a signaling NaN (sNaN), return that operand *quieted*.
- Otherwise, if any operand is a (quiet) NaN, return one of them *quieted*.
- Otherwise return `none` (meaning: "no NaN special-case, continue with Inf/finite rules").

The order is left-to-right: if two operands are both NaNs, we keep the first one. That is not a
deep mathematical choice (IEEE leaves payload selection somewhat implementation-defined), but it is
useful for reproducibility and it matches the kind of behavior you typically see when running
PyTorch models on IEEE hardware (payloads propagate in a deterministic, operand-order-dependent
  way).

## NaN propagation for ops (short-circuit lemmas)

Every IEEE32Exec op starts by calling `chooseNaN*`. If a NaN is selected, the definition returns it
immediately. These lemmas expose that "short-circuit" behavior so higher-level proofs can avoid
unfolding the full op definitions.

### Invalid operations (canonical NaN)

Some combinations of infinities and zeros are specified as *invalid* in IEEE-754 and return a NaN
(while also raising an invalid-operation flag in hardware). In our executable kernel we model the
return value: after confirming there is no NaN operand (i.e. `chooseNaN2 = none`), we return the
fixed bit-pattern `canonicalNaN`.

These lemmas expose those branches directly.

IEEE comparisons are *unordered* in the presence of NaNs.

Our executable comparator returns `Option Ordering`:

- `some ord` for the normal cases, and
- `none` when the comparison is unordered (because at least one side is NaN).

This matches what you see in practice in PyTorch/NumPy: e.g. comparisons with NaN are false, and
sorting has to pick an explicit policy for NaNs.

## `minNum` / `maxNum` (quiet-NaN ignoring)

IEEE-754 distinguishes two related families of min/max:

- `minimum` / `maximum`, which propagate NaNs, and
- `minNum` / `maxNum`, which (approximately) ignore quiet NaNs when the other operand is numeric.

Our definitions in `Exec32.lean` follow this common convention, and the lemmas below let proofs
reason about those branches directly.

In PyTorch terms, `minimum`/`maximum` behave like `torch.minimum`/`torch.maximum`, while
`minNum`/`maxNum` are closer to `torch.fmin`/`torch.fmax` (the "ignore NaN when possible" variants).
