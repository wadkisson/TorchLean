# Real helper lemmas for interval corner bounds

Several IEEEExec32 interval-soundness modules need the same basic real-analysis fact:

If `x ∈ [a,b]` and `y ∈ [c,d]`, then `x*y` is enclosed by the minimum/maximum of the four corner
products `{a*c, a*d, b*c, b*d}`.

This module keeps the interval arithmetic fact separate from the IEEEExec32 soundness proofs.

Corner enclosure for real multiplication on intervals.

If `x ∈ [a,b]` and `y ∈ [c,d]`, then:

`min(ac, ad, bc, bd) ≤ x*y ≤ max(ac, ad, bc, bd)`,

where the min/max are represented by `minOfFourReal`/`maxOfFourReal` with the same grouping used by the IEEE32Exec
4-corner rule implementations.
