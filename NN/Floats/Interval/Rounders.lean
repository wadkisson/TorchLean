# Directed rounding (down/up) for Flocq-style formats

For interval propagation under a *discrete* numeric grid (float, fixed-point, quantization), one
typically wants **directed rounding** at interval endpoints:

- `down x` is a representable value with `down x ≤ x`,
- `up x` is a representable value with `x ≤ up x`.

In IEEE-754 hardware this corresponds to rounding modes “toward -∞” and “toward +∞”. In TorchLean’s
proof-oriented model we represent this with Flocq-style rounding on `ℝ` via `neural_round` together with
the floor/ceil rounding functions from `NN/Floats/NeuralFloat/Rounding/Core.lean`.

This file is *format-generic*: it works for any radix `β` and exponent selection
function `fexp` satisfying `NeuralValidExp`.
