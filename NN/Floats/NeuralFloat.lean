# `NN.Floats.NeuralFloat`

This is the “rounding-on-ℝ” side of TorchLean’s float models. We use it when we want to talk about
formats and rounding generically, without committing to a concrete IEEE bit encoding:

- generic format/rounding infrastructure,
- the rounded scalar type `NF`,
- ULP-style error bounds and small calculation libraries.

Most files that are *not* bit-level IEEE execution live under `NN/Floats/NeuralFloat/`.
