# Floating-Point Error Bounds

We collect small, compositional error bounds for TorchLean’s Flocq-style rounding model.

The lowest-level rounding interface lives in `NN/Floats/NeuralFloat/Rounding/Core.lean`: once you have a rounding
mode `rnd : ℝ → ℤ` that satisfies the usual “round-to-nearest” property, you get the familiar
half-ULP bound for a single rounding step.

Here we package that core lemma into helper theorems that come up frequently in proofs, including
the `fl(x) = x(1+δ)` factorization.

Bounds for dot products, matrix operations, and backward stability require a concrete evaluation
order and format hypotheses. They belong with the corresponding algorithm rather than in this
generic one-step rounding file.

/--
Relative error for a nonzero exact value.

The proof argument prevents a computation with a nonzero error at exact value zero from being
misreported as having zero relative error. Use an absolute-error statement when the exact value may
vanish.
-/
noncomputable def relativeError (exact computed : ℝ) (_ : exact ≠ 0) : ℝ :=
  abs (computed - exact) / abs exact

/--
Relative error bound for a single `neural_round` step (ULP form).

This is the “divide the half-ULP absolute bound by `|x|`” version of the classic rounding model.
It is often the easiest lemma to use when a proof is naturally phrased in relative terms.
