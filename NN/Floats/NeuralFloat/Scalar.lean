# Rounded Scalar Interface

`NF` is the scalar-facing interface to generic rounding.  This folder keeps the carrier, conversion
operations, representability invariant, and neural-network scalar operations together.  The raw
carrier may contain any real value; statements that require membership in the declared grid use
`NF.IsRepresentable` explicitly.
