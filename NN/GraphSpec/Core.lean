# Sequential GraphSpec

This file defines the **sequential authoring surface** for GraphSpec.

The important design decision is:

- `DAG.Model` is the canonical general GraphSpec model representation.
- `Graph ps σ τ` is compact syntax for the common special case where the model is just a chain
  of layers.

So `Graph` is not a competing graph IR. It is a pleasant way to write:

```lean
Linear >>> ReLU >>> Linear
Conv >>> ReLU >>> Pool >>> Flatten >>> Linear
```

and then lower that chain to the general DAG representation when downstream tooling wants one
model shape for everything.

GraphSpec as a whole is a *typed* DSL for describing neural-network computations, with the explicit
goal of being usable in two complementary ways:

1. **Reference / proof semantics**: interpret the graph as a *pure* Lean function on tensors
   (`Interp.spec`). This is the semantics we want to reason about: shape safety, algebraic
   identities, equivalence of model refactorings, etc.
2. **Executable semantics**: compile the same graph into a backend-generic `TorchLean.Program`
   (`Compile.torchProgram`) so it can run on the TorchLean runtime (which can target eager or
   compiled execution backends).

Shapes and parameter shapes are part of the graph type.
Concretely, a graph is indexed by:

- `σ τ : Shape` — input/output tensor shapes, and
- `ps : List Shape` — the ordered list of parameter tensor shapes the graph expects.

That “parameter interface” is not a convention (like “whatever `state_dict()` happens to return”);
it is baked into the model type. Sequential composition concatenates parameter lists, and
evaluation splits them canonically.

## Why do this if PyTorch already exists?

PyTorch is excellent at *running* and *training* neural networks:

- `nn.Module` packages parameters and a `forward` method.
- Autograd records an operation tape during execution and provides gradients.
- Modern tooling can capture/transform graphs (`torch.fx`, `torch.export`) and compile them
  (`torch.compile`).

GraphSpec is not trying to replace any of that. Instead, it focuses on the pieces PyTorch does not
give us *inside Lean*:

- A machine-checkable **mathematical semantics** we can use for proofs.
- **Static shape discipline**: shapes appear in the type, not as runtime asserts.
- A **typed parameter interface**: parameter shapes and ordering are explicit, so “which tensor is
  weight #2?” is not an out-of-band convention.

In practice, the expected workflow is:

- use GraphSpec to write down a model architecture in a shape-typed way,
- run it via TorchLean for concrete execution/training experiments, and
- use `Interp.spec` and proof libraries to prove properties of the same architecture.

## Why do this if TorchLean already exists?

TorchLean is the **runtime and operator** layer: it gives us typed tensors, a backend interface,
and executable programs (`TorchLean.Program`) that can run under the autograd/training runtime.

GraphSpec is the **architecture/specification** layer: it gives us a small typed syntax for model
structure that comes with *two linked meanings*:

- a **pure** semantics (`Interp.spec`) that is amenable to proofs in Lean, and
- a **compiler** (`Compile.torchProgram`) that turns the same description into something runnable.

You *can* write models directly in TorchLean, but then the “thing you reason about” is already in
the executable world (monadic references + backend ops). For many proofs, it is much cleaner to
reason about a pure function `Params → Tensor → Tensor` and separately prove that compilation to
the runtime preserves that meaning.

In other words:

- TorchLean answers: “Given ops, how do we run/train them?”
- GraphSpec answers: “How do we describe models so we can both run them and prove things about
  them?”

## Mathematical View For Sequential Chains

For `g : Graph ps σ τ`, think of `g` as denoting a function

`⟦g⟧ : Params(ps) → Tensor σ → Tensor τ`.

In this file, that semantics is implemented by `Interp.spec`, and it is defined structurally:

- `⟦id⟧ params x = x`
- `⟦prim p⟧ params x = p.specFwd params x`
- `⟦g₁ >>> g₂⟧ params x`:
  split `params : Params(ps₁ ++ ps₂)` into `(params₁ : Params ps₁, params₂ : Params ps₂)`, then
  compute `⟦g₂⟧ params₂ (⟦g₁⟧ params₁ x)`.

The compiler `Compile.torchProgram` follows the same structure, but targets a monadic Torch
interface and expects arguments as `params ++ [input]` (matching `TorchLean.NN.Seq.program`).

## Scope of `Core.lean`

This file defines only the sequential core:

- `Primitive` — a single typed operation with both a pure spec and a TorchLean implementation.
- `Graph` — sequential composition (`>>>`) of primitives with a typed parameter list.
- `Interp.spec` — pure interpreter.
- `Compile.torchProgram` — compiler to `TorchLean.Program`.
- `LowerToDAG.Graph.toDAGTerm` / `toDAGModelZeroInit` — the bridge from chain syntax to the
  canonical DAG representation.

For skip connections, shared intermediates, residual adds, or other multi-input nodes, use
`NN.GraphSpec.DAG` directly.

## Direction

GraphSpec is intended to grow into a hygienic “write once, run/prove many” layer:

- richer primitive packs (vision, language, classical ML, …),
- richer DAG structure (limited control flow where it can be compiled),
- verified compilation passes (fusion, constant folding, layout transforms) with proofs that they
  preserve `Interp.spec`,
- a better parameter/initialization interface (explicit RNG threading, serialization, interop with
  PyTorch/ONNX exports),
- and a library of reusable theorems about common architectures (e.g. invariants of residual
  blocks, bounds for Lipschitz constants, etc.).

/-! ## Core graph language -/

/--
A *primitive node* in the GraphSpec language.

GraphSpec primitives package both sides of the “spec vs runtime” interface:

- a **pure spec forward** function (`specFwd`) used by the reference interpreter, and
- a **TorchLean program** (`torchProgram`) used by the compiler.

Optionally, a primitive may also provide a lowering to a TorchLean `LayerDef` (used to build a
`TorchLean.NN.Seq` for training ergonomics + deterministic parameter initialization). Not every
primitive needs this (e.g. control-flow-ish nodes kept outside the sequential layer).

Why a record?

- It lets us grow the op set by adding new primitives in new files (rather than editing a single
  global inductive just to extend the vocabulary).
- It keeps the “spec vs TorchLean” linkage explicit: when you add an op, you must define both
  interpretations side-by-side.

Type indices:

- `ps : List Shape` are the *parameter tensor shapes* this primitive expects, in order.
- `σ τ : Shape` are input/output tensor shapes.
-/
structure Primitive (ps : List Shape) (σ τ : Shape) where
  /-- Human-readable name used mainly for debugging / error messages. -/
  name : String

    ∀ {α : Type 0}, [Context α] →
      Runtime.Autograd.Torch.TList α ps → Tensor α σ → Tensor α τ
  /--
  Executable TorchLean program.

  The program expects its arguments as `ps ++ [σ]` (all parameters first, then the input).
  This convention aligns with how sequential TorchLean models (`TorchLean.NN.Seq`) expose their
  program interfaces.

    ∀ {α : Type 0}, [Context α] → [DecidableEq Shape] →
      Runtime.Autograd.TorchLean.Program α (ps ++ [σ]) τ

  We thread an occurrence index (`Nat`) so primitives can implement deterministic “per-layer”
  initialization (e.g. seed = f(index)).
  -/
  toLayerDefM? :
    Option (Nat → { l : Runtime.Autograd.TorchLean.NN.LayerDef σ τ // l.paramShapes = ps }) := none
  /-- Whether encountering this primitive should increment the layer-occurrence counter. -/
  countsAsLayer : Bool := false

/--
`Graph ps σ τ` is a (restricted) model that:
- takes an input tensor of shape `σ`,
- produces an output tensor of shape `τ`,
- and uses parameters whose shapes are listed in `ps` (in order).

This is a *sequential* (chain) graph language: the only composition operator is `seq` (`>>>`).
For sharing/skip connections, use `NN.GraphSpec.DAG`.

Implementation note:
- We encode the parameter list at the type level so composition automatically concatenates
  parameter lists (`ps := ps₁ ++ ps₂`).
- This means every graph has a canonical “ABI” for parameters: a single typed list `TList α ps`.
  When composing `g₁ : Graph ps₁ σ τ` and `g₂ : Graph ps₂ τ υ`, the composite graph expects
  parameters of shape list `ps₁ ++ ps₂`, and evaluation splits that list into the pieces needed by
  each subgraph.

/--
Primitive linear layer.

Mathematical semantics (vector case):

Let `x : Vec inDim`, `W : Mat outDim inDim`, and `b : Vec outDim`. Then:

`linear(W,b,x) = W * x + b`.

This matches the standard dense layer as in PyTorch `torch.nn.Linear` / `torch.nn.functional.linear`
(up to the usual row/column convention; here the shape indices make the intended dimensions
explicit).

Type-level parameter interface:

- parameter shapes are `[Mat outDim inDim, Vec outDim]`,
- input shape is `Vec inDim`,
- output shape is `Vec outDim`.

So a graph containing a `linear` node *forces* you to supply exactly a weight matrix and bias
vector of the right shapes, and it fixes their ordering in the model’s parameter list.

References:
- Dense layers are standard; for PyTorch behavior see `torch.nn.Linear` documentation.
- For the semantics used by the spec interpreter, see `NN.Spec.Module.Linear` (`Spec.linear_spec`).

Initialization semantics:
- we attach a TorchLean `LayerDef` so graphs can be lowered to `TorchLean.NN.Seq`,
- and we seed `W,b` deterministically from the layer-occurrence index:
  - `seedW = 2*i`, `seedB = 2*i + 1`.

The deterministic occurrence-index rule keeps end-to-end examples reproducible while preserving a
single GraphSpec → TorchLean → training path.

ReLU activation (parameter-free).

Mathematical semantics: elementwise `relu(x) = max(x, 0)`.

This is *shape-preserving* and *parameter-free*, so its parameter list is `[]` and its input/output
shape indices are both `s`.

/--
Last-axis softmax (parameter-free).

Softmax turns “logits” into a probability distribution along the *last* axis:

`softmax(x)_i = exp(x_i) / (∑_j exp(x_j))`.

In TorchLean’s spec layer, this is implemented as a genuine last-axis tensor softmax (recursing
over outer dimensions), analogous to `torch.softmax(x, dim=-1)` in PyTorch.

Notes:
- Softmax is *not* elementwise; it normalizes across an axis, so it is a canonical example of a
  non-pointwise activation.
- For numerical stability, practical implementations often rewrite softmax using `logsumexp`.
  The spec semantics here follows the dedicated `Activation.softmax_spec`.

/-! ## Lowering: sequential Graph → DAG term/model -/

/-!
GraphSpec has two surface syntaxes:

- `NN.GraphSpec.Core`: a *sequential* DSL (`Graph` + `>>>`), ideal for pure pipelines.
- `NN.GraphSpec.DAG.Core`: a *general* SSA/A-normal-form term language, ideal for sharing/skip
  connections.

The DAG term/model language is GraphSpec’s “general graph” core: it is the representation that can
express sharing and skip connections.

Sequential `Graph` exists because it is the clearest way to write pipelines, and it has its own
direct Spec semantics (`Interp.spec`) and compiler (`Compile.torchProgram`).

This lowering is still useful whenever you want to *embed* a sequential pipeline into the DAG world
(e.g. to reuse DAG-only tooling, or to keep a single GraphSpec example surface that can export DAG
models).

This section provides a structural lowering:

- `Graph.toDAGTerm` produces a `DAG.Term (ps ++ [σ]) τ`, i.e. a DAG term whose environment starts
  with the parameter list `ps` and ends with the (single) data input `σ`.
- `Graph.toDAGModelZeroInit` wraps that term into a `DAG.Model ps [σ] τ` with a simple default
  parameter initialization (all zeros).

Notes:
- The lowering is *purely structural*: it introduces `let1` binders between stages to make the
  sequential flow explicit in SSA form.
- Each sequential `Primitive ps σ τ` is embedded as a DAG primitive op with inputs `ps ++ [σ]`.
  This embedding is generic: any custom GraphSpec primitive automatically becomes usable in the
  DAG world.

### Deterministic initialization for sequential graphs

`Graph.toDAGModelZeroInit` is total, but its parameters are all-zero tensors, which is convenient
for proofs and shape-only examples but not representative of training setups.

For graphs whose primitives provide `Primitive.toLayerDefM?`, we can reuse TorchLean’s deterministic
initializers (e.g. Xavier init for linear weights) in a way that matches `ToTorchLean.toSeq`:

- we thread an occurrence index `i : Nat`,
- primitives with `countsAsLayer = true` increment it,
- and each primitive’s `LayerDef.initParams` uses seeds derived from `i`.

We expose this as `Graph.toDAGModelDetInit? : Except String (DAG.Model ...)`:
it fails if any primitive lacks a `toLayerDefM?` lowering.
-/

/--
Compute deterministic initialization tensors for a sequential `Graph`, threading a “layer
occurrence index”.

This matches `ToTorchLean.toSeq`’s notion of “occurrence”: only primitives with
`countsAsLayer = true` advance the counter.

Lower a sequential `Graph` to a DAG `Model`, using deterministic initialization.

This is the DAG analogue of `ToTorchLean.toSeq`’s initialization semantics: it uses each primitive’s
`toLayerDefM?` to obtain a TorchLean `LayerDef`, then reuses the `LayerDef.initParams`.

This returns `Except String` because not every primitive necessarily admits a `LayerDef` lowering.

/-! ## Semantics (sequential core) -/

/-!
The sequential DSL (`Graph` with `>>>`) has *direct* semantics:

- `Interp.spec` evaluates a sequential graph as a pure function on tensors, and
- `Compile.torchProgram` compiles it to a backend-generic `TorchLean.Program`.

Even though a sequential graph is semantically a path-shaped DAG, we keep the sequential
interpreter/compiler direct for two pragmatic reasons:

1. **Proof ergonomics.** For chain graphs, definitional reduction is much simpler when we evaluate
   directly rather than going through an SSA lowering.
2. **Engineering clarity.** The sequential and DAG languages have different invariants (parameter
   concatenation vs explicit `let1` sharing). Keeping each semantics close to its syntax makes the
   code easier to audit.

We still provide a structural lowering `LowerToDAG.Graph.toDAGModelZeroInit` so that DAG-only
  tooling
can consume sequential models. The DAG path becomes the canonical execution route when a caller
wants explicit sharing together with the corresponding simp lemmas / proof infrastructure.
