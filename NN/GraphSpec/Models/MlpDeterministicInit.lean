# MLP Deterministic Initialization

GraphSpec sequential graphs (`Graph` + `>>>`) have a *typed parameter ABI*:
each model comes with an explicit type-level list `ps : List Shape` describing the shapes and the
order of its parameter tensors.

For execution/training examples, we often want deterministic (but nontrivial) initialization rather
than “all zeros”. GraphSpec supports that by letting primitives optionally provide a TorchLean
`LayerDef` (via `Primitive.toLayerDefM?`), whose `initParams` uses occurrence-indexed seeds.

This file proves one concrete bridge theorem: for the 2-layer MLP
`Models.mlp`, the deterministic initialization obtained from GraphSpec is exactly the same typed
parameter list you would get by initializing the two TorchLean `Linear` layers directly with the
expected occurrence-indexed seeds.

That matters because GraphSpec models expose parameters by a typed ABI, not by mutable module
fields. This theorem checks that the ABI order used by GraphSpec initialization agrees with the
runtime layer order used by TorchLean.

/--
Deterministic init for `Models.mlp` is exactly the concatenation of the two TorchLean `Linear`
initializers.

Seed discipline:

- first linear layer uses occurrence index `0`, hence seeds `(0, 1)`,
- second linear layer uses occurrence index `1`, hence seeds `(2, 3)`.
