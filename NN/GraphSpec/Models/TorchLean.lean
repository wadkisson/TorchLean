# TorchLean-Executable GraphSpec Models

This module is the architecture-facing home for reusable model constructors that still execute via
the TorchLean autograd runtime.

The split is intentional:
- `NN.GraphSpec.Models.*` contains graph-authored architectures and architecture-facing wrappers.
- `NN.GraphSpec.Models.TorchLean.*` contains executable `TorchLean.NN.Seq` / `TorchLean.Program`
  constructors for common models.
- `NN.Runtime.Autograd.TorchLean.*` contains runtime machinery: tensors, ops, backends, sessions,
  losses, optimizers, and training loops.

Model authors work from GraphSpec, while runtime internals stay focused on execution.
