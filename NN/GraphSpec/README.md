# GraphSpec

GraphSpec is the layer between friendly model-building syntax and the low-level IR. It is useful
when an architecture's parameter layout, sharing structure, and pure semantics should be explicit
before the model is lowered or executed.

A GraphSpec model has two interpretations:

1. a pure specification semantics in Lean, and
2. a compiled TorchLean program that can run.

Use the subsystem entrypoint:

```lean
import NN.GraphSpec
```

`NN/IR` is the shared op-tagged graph IR used by runtime compilation and verification. GraphSpec is
an authoring layer that can feed the broader TorchLean pipeline; it is not a replacement for
`NN.IR.Graph`.

The intended reader is someone who wants more structure than `nn.Sequential` but still wants a
model-level object, not raw IR nodes. This includes residual models, shared subgraphs, architecture
families with named parameter lists, and examples where the same definition should be read as a
specification and as executable TorchLean code.

## Where GraphSpec Fits

| Layer | Best for |
| --- | --- |
| `nn.Sequential` | ordinary tutorials and training examples |
| `GraphSpec` | typed architecture authoring with explicit parameter layout and sharing |
| `NN.IR.Graph` | op-tagged graph artifacts for verification, widgets, and export |

The layers should not compete. A good workflow often uses all three:

1. write a model with the public API or GraphSpec,
2. lower it into a runtime or IR artifact,
3. use the IR artifact for execution traces, bound propagation, certificate replay, or a compiler
   theorem.

GraphSpec is most valuable when the architecture itself is part of the claim. If all you need is a
small training example, `nn.Sequential` is simpler. If all you have is an imported artifact, `NN.IR`
is the right boundary. GraphSpec sits between them: it gives a name to the model family, its
parameter order, its pure interpretation, and the executable lowering that should agree with that
interpretation.

## Sequential Graphs

`Graph ps σ τ` represents a chain from input shape `σ` to output shape `τ`, with parameter shapes
`ps : List Shape` tracked at the type level.

```lean
import NN.GraphSpec

open NN
open NN.GraphSpec

def g (inDim hidDim outDim : Nat) :=
  GraphSpec.Models.mlp inDim hidDim outDim

#check GraphSpec.Interp.spec (g 4 8 2)
#check GraphSpec.Compile.torchProgram (g 4 8 2)
#check GraphSpec.LowerToDAG.Graph.toDAGModelZeroInit (g 4 8 2)
```

Sequential graphs are the right surface for MLPs and simple feed-forward pipelines.

## DAG Models

`DAG.Term Γ τ` is the internal GraphSpec representation for explicit sharing and skip connections.
Its environment `Γ` contains parameters followed by data inputs, so the parameter interface stays
visible in the type.

DAG models provide:

| Object | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Term.eval` | pure specification semantics |
| `Term.compile` | executable TorchLean compilation |
| `DAG.Model` | packaged parameters, inputs, and body term |

Use DAG terms when a model needs residual connections, multiple inputs, or explicit reuse of an
intermediate value.

This is the place to represent architecture structure, not runtime state. Optimizer buffers, CUDA
device buffers, imported checkpoint bytes, and certificate JSON belong to the runtime,
interop, or verification layers. GraphSpec should describe the typed computation that those later
artifacts refer to.

## Architecture-Level Boundaries

When a model family is written in GraphSpec, there are several boundaries to keep explicit:

- the parameter ABI: list order, tensor shapes, and which tensors are shared;
- the pure semantics: what the architecture means over the spec scalar context;
- the executable lowering: which TorchLean runtime program is produced;
- the artifact boundary: which IR, JSON, or checker object later refers to this architecture.

This is why GraphSpec is a good home for residual networks, typed blocks, and shared-subgraph
families. It lets a proof talk about the architecture before a training run or imported checkpoint
adds runtime data.

## Adding A Primitive

A primitive must provide both a pure meaning and an executable TorchLean meaning.

For unary sequential layers, define a `Primitive ps σ τ`:

```lean
namespace NN
namespace GraphSpec
namespace Primitive

open Spec
open Tensor
open NN.Tensor

def myOp (s : Shape) : Primitive [] s s :=
  { name := "myOp"
    specFwd := fun {α} _ctx _params x => x
    torchProgram := fun {α} _ctx _deq =>
      fun {m} _ _ => fun x => pure x
    toLayerDefM? := none
    countsAsLayer := false }

end Primitive
end GraphSpec
end NN
```

If the same unary primitive is needed inside DAG syntax, embed it through:

```lean
LowerToDAG.Primitive.toDAGPrimOp
```

For true multi-input operations, define a `DAG.PrimOp ins τ` directly in `DAG.lean`.

## Proof Pattern

GraphSpec proofs compare the interpreter with an existing specification:

1. choose a compact model, such as an MLP or residual block;
2. state equality between `Interp.spec` or `DAG.Term.eval` and the reference forward function;
3. unfold the GraphSpec syntax and simplify with a focused simp set;
4. use the model-specific tensor lemmas for the remaining arithmetic.

See `NN/GraphSpec/Models/MlpSpecEquivalence.lean` for the smallest version of this pattern.

For a larger model, the same proof pattern should scale by proving facts about named primitives and
blocks first. The goal is not to unfold an entire architecture by hand every time; it is to make
model-family facts reusable, so later verification or export code can cite the architecture theorem
instead of re-deriving the shape and semantic story.

## What GraphSpec Can Support

GraphSpec is useful evidence when a claim needs an architecture-level statement:

- the parameter list has a specific shape and order,
- a residual connection really reuses the intended intermediate,
- a model family lowers to executable TorchLean code,
- a pure interpreter agrees with a reference spec for a compact architecture,
- the later IR/export/checker path is attached to a named model structure.

Robustness, native-runtime agreement, and checkpoint provenance are later claims. GraphSpec gives
those layers a named architecture, parameter ABI, and pure semantics to cite; verification, runtime,
and trust-boundary modules then state the additional assumptions or checks needed for the full
claim.
