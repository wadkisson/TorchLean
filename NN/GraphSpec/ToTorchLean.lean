# GraphSpec → TorchLean.NN.Seq (sequential lowering)

This provides a *structural lowering* from GraphSpec graphs into TorchLean sequential models.

## What is this lowering for?

GraphSpec gives us two things already:

- a **pure** denotational semantics (`Interp.spec`) for proofs / reference reasoning, and
- a compiler to an **executable** TorchLean program (`Compile.torchProgram`) for running/training.

So why do we also lower to `TorchLean.NN.Seq`?

`TorchLean.NN.Seq` is a small “training ergonomics” wrapper around a sequence of `LayerDef`s:

- it packages a *parameter shape list* (`paramShapes`) and deterministic parameter initialization,
- it provides a sequential forward program,
- and it plugs easily into existing training-loop code that expects a
  sequential layer stack.

GraphSpec remains the source of truth for the model structure. `Seq` is a secondary view for the
subset of models that are layer stacks.

## Partial compilation: `Except String`

Important design decision:

- GraphSpec itself is a **graph language**, not “a training framework”.
- Not every GraphSpec primitive should be forced to be a `LayerDef`.

So the lowering returns `Except String`: it succeeds for graphs whose primitives provide
`Primitive.toLayerDefM?`, and fails otherwise.

## Deterministic initialization (occurrence index)

We thread a `Nat` counter to support deterministic, occurrence-indexed initialization. This gives
the lowering a stable RNG boundary without making global randomness part of the graph syntax.

For example, the default `Primitive.linear` uses:
- `seedW = 2*i`, `seedB = 2*i + 1`.

See also:
- `NN.GraphSpec.Core` for the core sequential DSL and its `Compile.torchProgram` compiler.
- `NN.GraphSpec/README.md` for the high-level “GraphSpec vs TorchLean” motivation.

### Example (informal)

If `g : Graph ps σ τ` is built from primitives that provide `toLayerDefM?`, then:

- `ToTorchLean.toSeq g : Except String (TorchLean.NN.Seq σ τ)` gives a sequential model with
  deterministic initialization, and
- `Compile.torchProgram g : TorchLean.Program α (ps ++ [σ]) τ` gives the general executable program
  view (works even when there is no `Seq` lowering).

/--
Try to lower a sequential GraphSpec graph into a `TorchLean.NN.Seq`.

Use this when you specifically want the `Seq` wrapper for training ergonomics. If all you need
is an executable program, prefer `Compile.torchProgram`: it is the more general path and does not
require every primitive to have a `LayerDef` view.
