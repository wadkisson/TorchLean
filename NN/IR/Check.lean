# IR Validation

Validation helpers for `NN.IR.Graph`.

There are two validation levels:
- `Graph.checkWellFormed` lives in `NN.IR.Graph` and checks only graph structure: id discipline,
  parent arity, and topological ordering.
- `Graph.checkShapes` lives here and checks the declared `Node.outShape`s against the shared shape
  inference rules from `NN.IR.Infer`.

Shape logic has **one source of truth**: `Infer.inferNodeOutShape` states the per-op shape rules,
and `Graph.checkShapes` validates graph nodes through those rules.

## Prop-level well-formedness wrappers

The IR layer primarily exposes executable checkers (`checkWellFormed`, `checkShapes`) because
that is what compilers/backends/exporters need: either accept a graph or produce a readable error.

For proofs it is often nicer to assume a proposition instead of carrying around `Except String`:
`WellFormed g` means the checker succeeds, and similarly for `WellShaped g`.

These wrappers keep the executable checker names and proposition-level assumptions in the same
module.

  g.checkShapes = .ok ()
