# Shape Inference

Shape inference and consistency checking for `NN.IR.Graph`.

`NN.IR.Node` stores an `outShape` field because many consumers want shape metadata to be available
without re-running inference (pretty printers, exporters, verifiers, etc.).

This module provides an independent shape inference/checking procedure that recomputes the expected
output shape of each node from:
- the node's `OpKind` payload (when present), and
- the parent nodes' output shapes.

For parameterized ops whose output shape depends on external parameters (notably `OpKind.linear`),
we treat the node's declared `outShape` as an input to the checker and validate the local contracts
we can check (e.g. input/output are vectors).

This is the single source of truth for `Graph.checkShapes`: adding a new `OpKind` should extend
this match first, then the semantics/export/verification passes can rely on the same contract.

PyTorch analogy:
- `inferNodeOutShape` corresponds to shape propagation used when validating an FX graph.
- Where the true output shape depends on parameters, this module performs contract checking rather
  than attempting to read those parameters.

## Node-local inference

Most IR ops are “shape transparent” (elementwise, permute, etc.). A few need special handling:
- `matmul` has rank-sensitive rules (2D and a limited 3D batched case),
- `concat` needs to merge multiple parents along an axis,
- pooling/conv ops use centralized CHW arithmetic from `OpContracts`.

Infer the output shape of a node from its kind + parent shapes.
