# Semantics

Denotational semantics for `NN.IR.Graph`.

This file defines an evaluator for the current IR fragment:
- it evaluates nodes in SSA/topological order,
- each node applies the corresponding *spec-layer* tensor operation to its parents,
- parameter payloads for `const`, `linear`, and `conv2d` are supplied by an explicit `Payload`.

The evaluator is total on well-formed, well-shaped graphs and returns `Except String` on malformed
graphs or missing payloads.

Softmax and layer norm:
- `softmax axis` is interpreted as softmax along the given `axis`, but the spec primitive we have
  is last-axis softmax (`Activation.softmax_spec`). We therefore interpret non-last-axis softmax by
  *permuting* the requested axis to the last position, applying last-axis softmax, then permuting
  back. This matches the meaning of `torch.softmax(x, dim=axis)` in PyTorch.
- `layernorm axis` matches PyTorch's `F.layer_norm(x, normalized_shape=x.shape[axis:])` convention:
  `axis` selects the start of the **normalized suffix**. We implement this by reshaping the tensor
  into a 2D view `(seqLen, embedDim)`, applying the spec 2D LayerNorm (`Spec.layerNorm`), then
  reshaping back. This keeps the spec primitive small while supporting arbitrary ranks.

How this relates to PyTorch:
- `Graph.nodes` is analogous to a topologically-sorted IR like FX/TorchScript.
- `Payload` is analogous to “parameters / buffers / constants” that live outside the pure graph
  structure.
- The evaluator is a pure, denotational model of running the graph. It is designed for clarity and
  for connecting to proofs and verification passes (not for performance).

## Parameter payloads

The IR graph stores `OpKind` and `outShape`, but it does not embed tensor values for parameters.
Instead, evaluation is parameterized by a `Payload`:

- `const? id` supplies a constant tensor for a `const` node,
- `linear? id` supplies `W,b` for a `linear` node,
- `conv2d? id` supplies the convolution spec/weights for a `conv2d` node.

This matches how most graph formats work in practice: structure is one artifact, parameters are
another.
-/

/--
Payload record for a `const` node.

Constants are stored in a “flat” (1-D) representation so backends can keep a uniform container
(e.g. an array). During evaluation we check the flat length against `Shape.size` and then
`unflatten` to the requested `Shape`.
-/
structure ConstFlat (α : Type) [Context α] where
  /-- Number of scalar entries stored in the flat constant payload. -/
  n : Nat
  /-- Constant values stored as a vector before evaluation reshapes them to the IR node shape. -/
  v : Tensor α (.dim n .scalar)

/--
Payload record for a `linear` node: weight matrix `W` and bias vector `b`.

The node's input `x` comes from the graph edge; `W,b` live in the external `Payload` (similar to
ONNX initializers or a PyTorch `state_dict`).
-/
structure LinearWB (α : Type) [Context α] where
  /-- Output dimension. -/
  outDim : Nat
  /-- Input dimension. -/
  inDim  : Nat
  /-- Weight matrix in the PyTorch convention `outDim × inDim`. -/
  W : Tensor α (.dim outDim (.dim inDim .scalar))
  /-- Bias vector added after matrix-vector multiplication. -/
  b : Tensor α (.dim outDim .scalar)

/--
Payload record for a `conv2d` node.

We store the spec-layer `Conv2DSpec` together with the dimension parameters needed to reconstruct
it. The nonzero proofs are required by the spec-layer definition and ensure the convolution is
well-formed.
-/
structure Conv2DParams (α : Type) [Context α] where

  /-- Output channels. -/

  inH : Nat

  /-- Proof that the input channel count is nonzero, required by the spec convolution layer. -/
  hIn : inC ≠ 0
  /-- Proof that the kernel height is nonzero. -/
  hKH : kH ≠ 0

## Dynamic (shape-tagged) values

During evaluation we keep values in a dependent pair `Σ s, Tensor α s` so we can store a
  heterogenous
table of intermediate tensors while still recovering precise shapes when we need them.

## Small proof-helpers used by evaluation

The evaluator frequently needs evidence that an axis is valid or that a broadcast is legal so it can
call the spec-layer operations, which are typed with these preconditions. We build these witnesses
from runtime data (`Nat` axis values and shapes) using `Option`:

- returning `none` means the IR node is ill-formed for the given shapes,
- returning `some h` provides the witness needed to call the spec operator.
-/

/--
Build a witness that `axis` is a valid axis for shape `s`.

Many spec-layer ops (e.g. reductions, `softmax`, `layernorm`) are typed with a `Shape.valid_axis`
precondition. Since the IR stores axes as raw `Nat`, we reconstruct the witness at runtime.

Returns `none` when `axis` is out of bounds.
-/
def mkValidAxis? (axis : Nat) : (s : Shape) → Option (PLift (Shape.valid_axis axis s))
  | .scalar => none
  | .dim n rest =>
      match axis, n with
      | 0, Nat.succ k => some ⟨Shape.valid_axis.valid_zero (n := k) (s := rest)⟩
      | 0, 0 => none
      | Nat.succ a, Nat.succ k =>
          (mkValidAxis? a rest).map (fun h =>
            ⟨Shape.valid_axis.valid_succ (n := k) (s := rest) (k := a) h.down⟩)
      | Nat.succ _, 0 => none

/--
Build a witness that `s₁` can be broadcast to `s₂` (NumPy/PyTorch-style broadcasting).

The spec-layer broadcasting operator is typed with `Shape.CanBroadcastTo`. Since the IR stores only
runtime shapes, we reconstruct this witness on demand.

Returns `none` when broadcasting is not possible.
-/
def mkCanBroadcastTo? : (s₁ s₂ : Shape) → Option (Shape.CanBroadcastTo s₁ s₂)
  | .scalar, s₂ => some (.scalar_to_any s₂)
  | .dim n₁ t₁, .dim n₂ t₂ =>
      if hEq : n₁ = n₂ then

  | x :: rest, d + 1 => x :: swapAt rest d

/--
Compute a sequence of adjacent swaps that realizes a target permutation.

This is used to implement `.permute` by repeatedly applying `swapAdjacentAtDepth`, which is already
available in the spec tensor library. If the permutation is ill-formed, this returns an error
explaining what went wrong.
-/

  let mut cur : List Nat := List.range r
  let mut swapsRev : List Nat := []

        match findIndex? cur target with
        | none => throw s!"permute: internal error: target axis {target} not in current axes {cur}"

            let mut k := j
            while k > i do
              swapsRev := (k - 1) :: swapsRev
              cur := swapAt cur (k - 1)
              k := k - 1
  pure swapsRev.reverse

/--
Apply one adjacent-swap-at-depth to a dynamic tensor value.

This is the execution-level building block used to implement `.permute` in terms of repeated
adjacent swaps, reusing the spec tensor library's `swapAdjacentAtDepth`.
-/
def applySwapDepth {α : Type} [Context α] (v : DVal α) (d : Nat) : DVal α :=
  match v with
  | ⟨s, t⟩ =>
      let t' : Tensor α (s.swapAdjacentAtDepth d) := Tensor.swapAtDepthHelper (tensor := t) d
      ⟨s.swapAdjacentAtDepth d, t'⟩

/--
Permute a dynamic tensor value according to `perm`.

This checks that `perm` is a valid permutation for the input shape (using `Shape.permute?`), then
lowers it to a sequence of adjacent swaps and applies them to the tensor.
-/
def permuteDVal {α : Type} [Context α] (v : DVal α) (perm : List Nat) : Except String (DVal α) := do
  let sIn := v.shape
  match Spec.Shape.permute? sIn perm with
  | none => throw s!"permute: invalid permutation {repr perm} for shape {repr sIn}"
  | some _ =>
      let swaps ← swapDepthsForPerm perm (Shape.rank sIn)
      pure <| swaps.foldl (fun acc d => applySwapDepth (α := α) acc d) v

## Evaluation helpers

The evaluator itself (`evalAt` / `denoteAll`) is a fold over nodes. These helpers keep the fold
readable:
- `expectShape` enforces “dynamic shape agrees with declared `outShape`” at each step.
- `evalConst`/`evalLinear`/`evalConv2D` fetch and apply external payloads keyed by node id.

Evaluate node `i` given already computed parent values `vals`.

This is the core “one step” of the denotational semantics:
- lookup the node,
- read its parent values from `vals` (using the topo/id invariant),
- apply the corresponding spec-layer operation,
- enforce that the produced shape matches the node’s declared `outShape`.

This function assumes the graph is structurally well-formed (ids are in bounds and parents are
strictly smaller ids). `denoteAll` performs that check up front.

Evaluate a graph to a table of node values.

This returns an array `vals` of length `g.size` where `vals[i]` is the value of node `i`.

We do a structural well-formedness check once up front (ids/arity/topology). For compiler-produced
graphs, the boolean `Graph.wellFormed` check is a fast path; if it fails we fall back to the
exception-producing `Graph.checkWellFormed` so callers get a readable error message.

The evaluator is total in the sense that it always returns either:
- `.ok vals` (all nodes evaluated successfully), or
- `.error msg` describing the first failure (malformed IR, missing payload, or a local shape error).
