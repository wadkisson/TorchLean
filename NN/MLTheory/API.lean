Public entry point for machine-learning theory modules.

The imports collected here expose optimization, robustness, generative-model, Lyapunov, and
self-supervised results without requiring users to know the internal proof layout.

# `NN.MLTheory.API`

This is the recommended entrypoint for TorchLean's formal “ML theory” layer.

It collects the core specifications, executable checkers, and theorems into a single import. The
subdirectories still contain focused implementation modules, but users should not need separate
top-level umbrellas such as `NN.MLTheory.Optimization` or `NN.MLTheory.SelfSupervised`.

## Optimization theory

The optimization layer has three levels:
- executable optimizer equations over TorchLean `Spec.Tensor`s;
- exact `ℝ` convergence theorems for gradient-descent-style operators;
- a calculus bridge from strong convexity to strong monotonicity of `∇f`.

The tensor/runtime and real-analysis layers are deliberately separate. To use a convergence theorem
for a concrete model, a model-specific bridge still has to identify the runtime gradient with the
mathematical operator and account for floating-point error.

## Self-supervised objectives

The SSL theory modules formalize a finite predictive-view objective algebra:

- MAE is predictive-view SSL with identity/pixel targets;
- JEPA is predictive-view SSL with latent target representations;
- VICReg and Barlow-style terms are reusable geometry/non-collapse guards; and
- masked/context-target prediction can be read as finite view-graph energy.

The concrete Euclidean layer also proves that positive-edge alignment energy is nonnegative, that
fully collapsed embeddings can still obtain zero alignment energy, and that a positive
variance-floor guard assigns positive objective value to collapsed representations in nonzero
dimension.

These are objective semantics, not special-purpose layers: API training helpers can feed the same
masked/reconstruction or joint-embedding targets into an MLP, CNN, ViT, Mamba block, or custom model.

## Verified-network integration

This entrypoint also imports the CROWN soundness layer and the NeuralFloat error-bound layer so
verification statements and floating-point error statements compile together through one surface.

Notes:
- The tactic frontends for external certificate tooling are kept out of this umbrella; import them
  explicitly when needed. The oracle-backed Lyapunov interface itself is re-exported here as part
  of the current `NN.MLTheory` surface.
- This module does not define additional convenience APIs; those belong in `NN.Runtime` or
  `NN.Examples` rather than the theory layer.
