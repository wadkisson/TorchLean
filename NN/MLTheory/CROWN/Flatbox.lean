# Flattened interval bounds (`FlatBox`)

`FlatBox α` is a small container for interval bounds on a *flattened* tensor value.

It is used by the graph-based LiRPA/CROWN development (`NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Graph`) and by some
operator-level transfer rules that operate on flattened vectors (e.g. slice/reduce rules).

`dim` is the flattened size, and `lo`/`hi` are tensors of shape `.dim dim .scalar`.

Componentwise validity of a flat interval box: `lo ≤ hi` for every coordinate.

This is a proof layer predicate; it uses the order carried by `Context α`, which keeps all CROWN
box predicates in the same scalar universe as the executable operators.
