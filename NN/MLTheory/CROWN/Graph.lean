# CROWN Graph

Public façade for the graph-based LiRPA/CROWN engine.

The code is organized into focused modules:
- `Graph/Core`: graph aliases, flattened affine-bound state, and propagation state records,
- `Graph/Engine`: the executable engine: IBP, derivative IBP, forward affine CROWN, and
  objective-dependent backward CROWN,
- `Graph/Backward`: a narrow import façade for users who want the backward-CROWN chapter name,
- `Graph/Theorems`: shape, dimension, and enclosure lemmas used by proof modules.

Import this module when you want the complete graph engine API.
