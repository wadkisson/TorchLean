# Flat LiRPA Engine

Executable graph engine for interval propagation, affine forms, and CROWN-style transfer rules.

- `Engine.Base`: flat vectors, boxes, parameter stores, and shared tensor helpers.
- `Engine.IBP`: interval bound propagation.
- `Engine.Derivatives`: first- and second-derivative interval passes.
- `Engine.Affine`: affine-form propagation.
- `Engine.CROWN`: forward CROWN/DeepPoly bounds.
- `Engine.BackwardObjective`: objective-dependent backward CROWN.
