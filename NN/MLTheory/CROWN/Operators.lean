# CROWN Operator Index

This module re-exports the reusable operator-level transfer rules used by the graph-based
LiRPA/CROWN engine (`NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Graph`): activations, arithmetic, batch normalization, and
shape/indexing operations. Pooling and axis reductions are implemented directly by the graph
engine, where shape and nonempty-window checks are available.

Trigonometric operators remain opt-in because `tan`/`atan` require an extra scalar-function
interface beyond the project-wide `Context`. Import them explicitly when needed:

`import NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Operators.Trigonometric`
