# GAN theory

TorchLean's baseline GAN spec uses least-squares GAN losses.  This avoids partial logarithms in the
public spec surface while still capturing the generator/discriminator game:

- the discriminator regresses real samples toward score `1` and generated samples toward `0`;
- the generator tries to make generated samples score as real.

These lemmas expose the exact composition and loss decomposition used by examples and downstream
verification work.

The mathematical reason this file is more compact than the VAE/VQ-VAE theory files is that the
public spec deliberately chooses the LSGAN square-loss objective rather than the original minimax
`log D + log(1-D)` objective.  That keeps the executable Lean surface total over every supported
scalar backend; logarithmic GAN objectives belong in a domain-restricted layer with explicit
`0 < D(x) < 1` assumptions.  The facts below are therefore the safe core: they make the
generator/discriminator composition and the score-regression targets transparent, without smuggling
analytic side conditions into a total spec.

/--
LSGAN generator loss regresses fake scores toward the real target.

This is the generator side of Mao et al.'s least-squares objective: the generator does not receive
the discriminator's "fake" target; it tries to move generated samples onto the real-score target.

/--
LSGAN discriminator loss splits into real-score and fake-score regression terms.

The first term pushes `D(x_real)` toward `1`; the second pushes `D(G(z))` toward `0`.  Keeping this
as a named theorem gives downstream examples and proof files a stable reference point for the game
semantics, instead of requiring them to unfold the spec directly.
