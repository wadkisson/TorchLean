# Universal-approximation proofs

This entrypoint collects the constructive ReLU approximation layer. The chapter is organized around
one mathematical spine:

- one-dimensional constructive ReLU approximation by hinge sums;
- quantitative width/rate refinements;
- finite-precision lifts through `FP32` and executable `IEEE32Exec` semantics; and
- an `n`-dimensional Stone-Weierstrass bridge through coordinate polynomials.

The point is not only that a ReLU MLP exists. We also record how the exact real-valued construction
connects to TorchLean's spec-level MLP and to executable binary32 arithmetic.
