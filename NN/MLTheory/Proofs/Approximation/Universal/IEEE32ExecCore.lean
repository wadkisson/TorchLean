# Shared IEEE32Exec helpers for approximation theorems

This module contains the backend-generic glue used by the executable universal-approximation
theorems. We keep it independent of any one approximation construction (hinge sums, shallow ReLU
MLPs, convolutional models, or transformer-style models) and record the common semantic operations:

- extracting the scalar output of a one-output network,
- evaluating a two-layer ReLU MLP over the executable `IEEE32Exec` scalar type,
- mapping executable IEEE binary32 values back to their real denotation, and
- interpreting executable linear-layer parameters as real parameters.

The mathematical role is the standard one in floating-point analysis: separate the exact real
network from the concrete IEEE-754 execution, then bridge the two by explicit rounding hypotheses
or verified rounding lemmas.  Useful references for this separation are IEEE Std 754-2019,
Goldberg's survey on floating-point arithmetic, and Higham's treatment of numerical error
analysis.  The ReLU approximation side is connected through `ReLUMlpBridge`, which supplies the
real-valued MLP semantics used by the universal-approximation files.

/--
Extract the only scalar from a one-output `IEEE32Exec` tensor.

Most approximation statements end with scalar-valued targets.  Keeping this as a named helper makes
the shape boundary explicit instead of hiding the `Fin 1` index proof at every call site.

  match t with
  | .dim f => Tensor.toScalar (f ⟨0, by decide⟩)

/--
Evaluate a two-layer ReLU MLP over executable IEEE binary32 semantics.

The corresponding real-valued evaluator is `mlpEvalNd` from `ReLUMlpBridge`.  Approximation
theorems compare `IEEE32Exec.toReal (mlpEvalNd xI)` against that real evaluator applied to
`tensorToReal xI`, thereby isolating the floating-point execution error from the approximation
and quantization errors.

/--
Shape-preserving map over TorchLean specification tensors.

Lean's dependent tensor shape is part of the type, so the map is recursive over shapes rather than
implemented as a runtime loop. Coercions such as `tensorToReal` stay definitionally transparent in
downstream proofs.

/--
Interpret an executable IEEE tensor as the exact real tensor denoted by its entries.

This is not a cast to mathematical reals with ideal arithmetic; it is the semantic interpretation
of the concrete IEEE value after execution has already happened.

noncomputable def tensorToReal {s : Shape} (t : Tensor IEEE32Exec s) : Tensor ℝ s :=
  tensorMap IEEE32Exec.toReal t

/--
Interpret executable linear-layer parameters as real-valued parameters entrywise.

This helper is used in three-term bounds:
real approximation error + parameter quantization error + concrete execution error.
