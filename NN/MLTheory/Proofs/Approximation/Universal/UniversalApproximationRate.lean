# Universal approximation (1D, explicit rate)

This file strengthens `relu_universal_approximation_Icc` by choosing an explicit hidden width in
terms of the Lipschitz constant `L`, the interval length `(b-a)`, and the target accuracy `ε`.

The bound is the standard `O(1 / hidDim)` rate coming from piecewise-linear interpolation:
we pick

`hidDim = ⌈(2 * L * (b - a)) / ε⌉ + 1`,

which guarantees uniform approximation error `< ε` on `Set.Icc a b`.

Mathematically, this is the quantitative sibling of the constructive one-dimensional ReLU
universal approximation proof in `UniversalApproximation`: sample a Lipschitz function on a
uniform grid, interpolate linearly by hinge functions, and choose the grid fine enough that the
Lipschitz modulus controls the interpolation error.  The style is classical approximation theory
(Pinkus) and agrees with the first-order rate used in modern ReLU-network approximation analyses
such as Yarotsky's quantitative bounds.

/--
The chosen width makes the mesh-size error term smaller than the target accuracy.

This is the arithmetic heart of the explicit-rate theorem: the ceiling construction ensures
`N > 2L(b-a)/ε`, hence `2L(b-a)/N < ε`.
