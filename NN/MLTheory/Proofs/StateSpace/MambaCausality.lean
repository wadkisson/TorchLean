# Causality of S4/Mamba-style recurrent blocks

This file proves the sequence-causality property expected of state-space sequence models:
appending future tokens cannot change outputs already emitted for a prefix.

We state the theorem at the list-runner level rather than for a particular CUDA kernel. Runtime
implementations may use chunked or parallel selective scan, but they must refine these spec
runners. Combined with `NN.MLTheory.StateSpace.diagonalSelectiveScan_append`, this gives the
proof layer contract for Mamba/S4-style causal sequence processing.

Diagonal S4 prefix causality.

Appending future tokens `ys` cannot change the outputs already produced for prefix `xs`.

Compact Mamba prefix causality.

If a sequence `xs` has already been processed, appending future tokens `ys` cannot change the
outputs for `xs`.  This is the recurrent-model analogue of causal attention non-anticipation.

Full selective Mamba prefix causality for the internal runner.

The internal runner carries a newest-first causal convolution history.  Even with that extra state,
future input tokens only affect future outputs.

Full selective Mamba prefix causality for the public runner.

This is the user-facing theorem: extending the input stream preserves all previously produced
outputs.
