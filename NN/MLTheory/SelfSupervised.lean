# Self-supervised learning theory

This is the umbrella import for TorchLean's finite self-supervised objective semantics.

The chapter contains:
- masking primitives for patch/token objectives;
- predictive-view SSL objective algebra;
- MAE-style masked reconstruction losses;
- JEPA-style joint-embedding prediction losses; and
- VICReg/Barlow-Twins-style finite collapse guards.

This layer is kept modest: these files formalize the objective-level contracts that model
code should preserve, rather than claiming full optimization or population generalization guarantees.
That keeps the statements reusable across ViT, convolutional, Mamba, or custom backbones.
