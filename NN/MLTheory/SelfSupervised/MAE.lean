# Masked Autoencoder Objective Semantics

This module formalizes the finite patch/token core of a masked autoencoder (MAE):

- an input is a finite collection of patches `Fin n → Patch`;
- an encoder/decoder stack is abstracted to a reconstruction function;
- the objective is a sum of per-patch losses over the masked indices.

The formalization focuses on the semantic core. It captures the semantics that examples and future model
helpers should preserve, while leaving ViT blocks, convolutional patch embeddings, and image IO in
the executable API layer.

Paper anchor: “Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners” (He, Chen, Xie, Li, Dollár,
Girshick, 2021), arXiv:2111.06377.  The key objective-level fact we encode is that the
reconstruction loss is taken over the masked patch set.  Therefore the objective should not depend
on an arbitrary ordering of masked patch indices; `maeLoss_reverse` is the small finite theorem
capturing that property.

MAE-style masked reconstruction loss over an explicit masked-index list.

The list is the serialized representation of the masked set. The theorems below prove that the
objective behaves like a set sum for basic reorderings/decompositions.

The MAE loss is invariant under reversing the order of the masked-index list.  This is the small
