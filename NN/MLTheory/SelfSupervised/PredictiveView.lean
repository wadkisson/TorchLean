# Predictive-view semantics for self-supervised learning

This file is the objective-algebra layer for finite self-supervised learning.

The guiding split is:

* a **prediction/alignment** term, over compatible finite views; and
* a **geometry/non-collapse** term, such as variance, covariance, redundancy, negative-sample, or
  teacher-dynamics regularization.

The statements here are deliberately finite and method-neutral. They do not claim that SSL
optimization learns good representations. They prove a smaller semantic fact that is useful for
TorchLean and for paper writing: MAE, JEPA, VICReg-style guards, Barlow-style guards, and
autoregressive prediction can share one objective shape.

In this finite layer, a view-prediction contract has:

* `targetIdxs`, the selected masked/target indices;
* a context value;
* a target value at every finite index;
* a target encoder, which chooses the target space;
* a predictor from context and index; and
* a nonnegative geometry guard.

MAE is recovered by choosing the identity target encoder into patch/pixel space. JEPA is recovered
by choosing the target representation itself as the target space. VICReg/Barlow-style objectives are
represented as geometry guards that can be added orthogonally to either prediction objective.

/--
A finite predictive-view contract.

`Target` is the raw target-view type, `TargetRep` is the space after the target encoder, and
`Prediction` is the predictor output space. Keeping these three types separate is the whole point:
MAE sets `TargetRep = Target` with an identity encoder; JEPA uses a latent target representation;
contrastive and redundancy-reduction methods can reuse the same contract with different geometry
guards.

The context is `Unit` because the finite MAE skeleton already abstracts away the encoder. The
target encoder is identity into patch/pixel space.

JEPA as a predictive-view contract when the finite `target` is already a target representation.

This matches `jepaLoss`: target representations are values at the objective boundary, and the
predictor tries to match them at selected target indices.

/--
More general JEPA/predictive-view contract with a separate target encoder.

This is the paper bridge: changing `targetEncoder` changes the target space while leaving the
finite view-prediction algebra alone. MAE is the special case where this encoder is identity into
pixels/patches; JEPA uses a latent/stopped target branch.

/-! ## Concrete finite Euclidean geometry

The generic objective above is intentionally method-neutral. The definitions below add pressure:
representations are finite real vectors, alignment is squared Euclidean energy on a finite positive
view graph, and non-collapse is expressed as a real variance-floor guard over coordinate-spread
summaries.

These theorems capture an important SSL fact in a checked finite setting:

* graph alignment alone is nonnegative but accepts fully collapsed representations with zero loss;
* a positive variance floor assigns positive penalty to collapsed coordinate-spread summaries.
