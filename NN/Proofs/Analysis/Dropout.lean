# Dropout analysis properties

TorchLean splits stochastic training-mode dropout into two pieces:

- a mask/seed producer, treated as non-differentiated data in autograd proofs, and
- a deterministic tensor map once the mask or inference probability is fixed.

This file records the spec-level identity for the deterministic inference map. The fixed-mask
training-mode derivative infrastructure lives with the autograd tape-node proofs.

Overfitting”.
