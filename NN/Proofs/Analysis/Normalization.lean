# Normalization analysis properties

This file records theorem-level properties of TorchLean's normalization specs. The executable and
spec definitions live in `NN.Spec.Layers.Normalization`; this file belongs under
`NN.Proofs.Analysis` because it proves algebraic facts about those definitions over `ℝ`.

Current focus:
- **BatchNorm inference is affine** in the input `x` when the running statistics are fixed.

That fact matters because inference-time BatchNorm can be folded into a preceding/following affine
layer for verification, bound propagation, and simplification. Training-mode BatchNorm has
batch-dependent statistics and is not claimed by this theorem.

## BatchNorm inference is affine

At inference time, BatchNorm uses fixed running mean/variance. The resulting function is affine:

`y = x ⊙ scale + bias`.

/--
Scalar algebra behind inference-time BatchNorm folding.

For fixed mean `μ`, scale `γ`, shift `β`, and standard deviation `std`, the expression

`((x - μ) / std) * γ + β`

is affine in `x`, with multiplicative coefficient `γ / std` and bias
`β - μ * (γ / std)`.

Shape-generic tensor version of `batchNorm_inference_affine_scalar`.

All operations here are pointwise tensor ops, so the proof is structural induction on the tensor
shape. This private theorem handles the algebra after BatchNorm parameters have already been
broadcast to the input shape.

Inference-time BatchNorm is affine in the input `x`.

This is the public theorem users want for verification and graph simplification:

`batchNormInference x runningMean runningVar gamma beta epsilon`

is definitionally equal to a pointwise affine map

`x * (gamma / std) + (beta - mean * (gamma / std))`

after broadcasting channel parameters to the input shape and clamping the running variance exactly
as the spec does.
