# Any

Bridge lemmas between the proved typed context (`TList`) and the runtime tape representation
(`Runtime.AnyTensor` stored in `Array`s).

This is part of the explicit trust boundary: the runtime engine operates on erased tensors, while
the proved model keeps shapes at the type level.

Convert a typed context (`TList`) into a runtime list of erased tensors (`AnyTensor`).

This is part of the “trust boundary” between the proved model (typed shapes) and the runtime engine
(erased shape/value pairs).

Every `(pid, tensor)` produced by `toIndexedAnyList ts start` satisfies `pid < start + ss.length`.

This is bookkeeping used to prove runtime backward only references earlier nodes.

### Shape-erasing conversions

The lemmas below show that these conversions preserve length/order and interact well with
`TList.snoc` and `TList.get`. They’re used later to relate runtime node ids to positions in the
typed proof context `Γ ++ ss`.
-/

/--
`toAnyList` commutes with appending a value: converting `snoc xs t` is `toAnyList xs ++ [t]`.

Array lookup through `toAnyArray` corresponds to `TList.get` (up to the `AnyTensor` wrapper).

This is the key lemma that lets us connect runtime indexing (`arr[i]`) to proof indexing (`get xs
  i`).
