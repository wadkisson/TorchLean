# Spec-level gradient identities for the linear layer

This file states (and in several cases, proves by definitional unfolding) the “obvious” gradient
formulas for a linear layer:

`y = W x + b`

namely:
- `∂L/∂W = δ ⊗ x` (outer product),
- `∂L/∂x = Wᵀ δ` (matrix-vector multiply), and
- `∂L/∂b = δ`.

## What these theorems are (and are not)
- These are **spec-level** identities over TorchLean’s tensor encodings, not a full calculus layer
  about Frechét derivatives.
- Several proofs are `rfl` after unfolding definitions, because the corresponding specs are
  implemented directly in that form.

## PyTorch correspondence / citations

- `torch.nn.Linear` / `torch.nn.functional.linear` implement `y = x Wᵀ + b` with weight stored as
  shape `(out_features, in_features)` (so the math “matrix” is `W` with output rows). TorchLean’s
  `LinearSpec` follows the same convention: `weights : Tensor α (.dim outDim (.dim inDim .scalar))`.

  https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.functional.linear.html
- The “outer product” view of the weight gradient corresponds to the common vector formula
  `grad_W = δ ⊗ x` (PyTorch has `torch.outer` for vectors).
  https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.outer.html

## Why keep this file
Even when proofs are definitional, having them recorded explicitly helps:
- document the intended math semantics of the “backward specs”,
- provide simple regression checks when refactoring tensor encodings, and
- serve as stepping stones for the more advanced autograd soundness proofs in
  `NN/Proofs/Autograd/*`.

Spec identity: weight gradient for a linear layer.

For `y = W x + b`, if `δ = ∂L/∂y` then the weight gradient is

`∂L/∂W = δ ⊗ x`.

PyTorch mental model: this is the per-sample formula whose batched version becomes a matmul
against the input batch.

Shape/typing theorem: all backward specs return tensors of the expected shapes.

This is “free” from Lean’s dependent types, but it is sometimes convenient as a lemma when writing
documentation-style proofs.
