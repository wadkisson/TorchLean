# Model-Level Proofs

This module is the stable proof umbrella for properties of complete model components.

The separation is intentional:
- `NN.Spec.*` defines reusable mathematical and executable specifications;
- `NN.Proofs.Autograd.*` proves differentiation and tape/runtime correctness;
- `NN.Proofs.Models.*` proves model-facing invariants such as attention mask laws, attention-weight
  normalization, and architecture equivariances.

Keeping model theorems behind this one import gives public users a clean path without asking them to
guess which attention leaf file contains the fact they need.
