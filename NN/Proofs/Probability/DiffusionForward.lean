# Diffusion forward process: Gaussian noising

This file gives a small, Mathlib-backed formalization of the *forward* (noising) step used in
diffusion models, expressed as an affine pushforward of the standard Gaussian measure.

We work in a finite-dimensional real inner product space `E` equipped with its Borel σ-algebra.

Main definitions:
* `forwardNoising a b x` : the measure of `x' = a • x + b • z` with `z ∼ stdGaussian E`.
* `forwardKernel a b` : the associated Markov kernel `x ↦ forwardNoising a b x`.

Main facts:
* `forwardNoising` is Gaussian (`ProbabilityTheory.IsGaussian`), hence a probability measure.
* `forwardKernel` is a Markov kernel (`ProbabilityTheory.IsMarkovKernel`).

/-- Forward noising measure for a diffusion step:
`x' = a • x + b • z` with `z ∼ stdGaussian E`.

This is the measure-level analogue of the forward process used in DDPM-style diffusion models:
the current clean state `x` is scaled by `a`, and isotropic Gaussian noise is scaled by `b` and
added. The exact schedule that chooses `a` and `b` belongs to the model spec; this theorem layer
only needs the affine-Gaussian kernel shape.

  ((ProbabilityTheory.stdGaussian E).map (b • (ContinuousLinearMap.id ℝ E))).map
    (fun y ↦ a • x + y)

/--
The two-step definition of `forwardNoising` is equal to one direct affine pushforward.

The definition is written in stages so typeclass inference can see a Gaussian pushforward through a
linear map followed by translation; this lemma is the cleaner formula downstream proofs usually want.

/--
The forward diffusion transition is a Markov kernel.

This packages measurability and probability-mass obligations so later verification statements can
compose diffusion steps as kernels rather than manually carrying measure facts.

/--
Applying the kernel at state `x` recovers exactly the forward-noising measure at `x`.

The kernel is built from `id × const stdGaussian` so it fits Mathlib kernel
composition; this theorem reconnects that construction to the simpler noising formula.
