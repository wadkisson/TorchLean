# RL Trust-Boundary Proofs

`NN.Runtime.RL.Boundary.Core` provides executable “trust-boundary” checkers for externally supplied
RL data. Those checkers return `Except String ...` so runtime code can fail fast with clear error
messages. JSON rollout parsing lives one layer higher in `NN.Runtime.RL.Boundary.Json`; the proof
bridge here only needs the contract and checker semantics.

For formal reasoning, we also want a Prop-level view of exactly what was checked:

- `Runtime.RL.Boundary.ObservationHolds`
- `Runtime.RL.Boundary.RewardHolds`
- `Runtime.RL.Boundary.DoneFlagsHolds`
- `Runtime.RL.Boundary.ContractHolds`

This module provides the bridge lemmas that turn a successful executable check (`= .ok ...`) into
the corresponding Prop-level statement.

Run the executable checker and, on success, return the transition bundled with the Prop-level
contract proof.

This is the “checked preconditions” interface for downstream proofs/programs:
instead of assuming a contract, you explicitly *check* it and obtain a usable hypothesis.
