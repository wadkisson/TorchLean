# GridWorld proof layer

This module proves a small set of “environment well-formedness” facts for the Lean-native
GridWorld defined in `NN.Spec.RL.Envs.GridWorld`:

- the step function keeps coordinates in bounds,
- rewards are bounded (`reward ∈ [-1, 0]`),
- the induced one-hot `FiniteStochastic.MDP` view satisfies the row-stochastic axioms
  (`transition_nonneg` and `transition_sums_to_one`).

These lemmas expose the environment invariants needed by downstream RL algorithms, so later
proofs can depend on a stable interface instead of re-opening the step function each time.

## Finite-stochastic MDP validity

The `FiniteStochastic.MDP` view of GridWorld represents deterministic transitions as one-hot rows.
Here we show this satisfies the standard “row-stochastic” assumptions used throughout the
finite-state proof development.

## Deterministic / One-Hot Equivalence

The finite-stochastic GridWorld view is not a different environment. It packages the deterministic
successor as a one-hot transition row. The next theorem makes that bridge explicit at the Bellman
interface: taking an expectation against that one-hot row is the same as reading the value of the
deterministic successor state.
-/

/--
Expected next-state value in the one-hot finite-stochastic GridWorld view equals the value of the
successor produced by the deterministic finite-MDP view.
