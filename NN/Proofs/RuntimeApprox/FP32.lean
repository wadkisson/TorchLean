# FP32 Runtime Approximation

Specialization of the backend-generic approximation library to TorchLean's FP32 rounding model.

These modules package layer, MLP, and CROWN/IBP margin lemmas so downstream examples can state
“real spec result plus explicit FP32 error budget” without reassembling the numeric backend each
time.
