# NF Shape Operators

NF (rounded) backend: approximation lemmas for shape-only tensor operators.

These operators do not perform arithmetic on scalars (they only permute/replicate entries), so
they preserve existing `approxT` error bounds.

That distinction matters: shape-only ops should not introduce extra rounding error. Their proofs
are mostly transport/indexing arguments rather than numerical analysis.

## PyTorch correspondence / citations
These are the proof analogues of “view-like”/index-rearrangement ops in PyTorch which do not change
floating-point values, only their arrangement:

/-- Filling a tensor preserves a scalar approximation budget at every shape.

Although this fact is used heavily when constructing reverse-mode zero contexts, it is a shape
fact rather than a backward-mode fact. Keeping it here also makes rounded constants available to
normalization, attention, and quantization without importing the reverse-mode implementation.

/-- Applying the same Boolean mask to exact and rounded tensors preserves the error budget.

Masking is a selection operation, not arithmetic: allowed entries are unchanged and blocked
entries are exactly zero in both semantics. In particular, this theorem does not model a finite
negative sentinel and introduces no extra ULP term.
