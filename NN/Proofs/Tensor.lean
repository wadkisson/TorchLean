# Tensor Proofs

Stable umbrella for TorchLean's tensor proof layer.

The folder is split by role:

- `NN.Proofs.Tensor.Algebra` contains backend-generic algebra over semirings. It is the right import
  for autograd soundness proofs that should not commit to `ℝ`.
- `NN.Proofs.Tensor.Basic` contains the real-valued, spec-facing tensor toolkit used by analysis,
  Lipschitz, normalization, attention, and model-level proofs.

Use this umbrella from public entrypoints and CI. Import the leaf modules directly only when a proof
keeps the dependency surface focused.
