# Loss

Loss-function correctness lemmas for the IR → compiled runtime bridge.

The IR node kind `.mse_loss` is compiled into an SSA node whose `forward` computes the
specification-level mean squared error loss.

This file proves the forward-correctness lemma for that compilation step: on successful compilation
at position `i`, the IR evaluator `NN.IR.Graph.denoteAllFrom` and the compiled evaluator
`denoteAllState` append the same result.

This is a structural correctness statement: it is not about generalization, training convergence,
or statistical properties of MSE; it simply connects the IR semantics to the compiled runtime node.

## Main definitions

- `buildFrom_denoteAllFrom_mse_loss`: correctness step for `.mse_loss` lowering.

## Implementation notes

- We keep this theorem in a dedicated file because it is heavier than most per-op steps.
- The proof structure follows the compiler's guard sequence, including the dependent shape checks.
- This file can build slowly because MSE touches two parents, a scalar output shape, and a sequence
  of compiler guards. Repeated guard eliminations belong in focused helper lemmas, leaving the
  theorem focused on the loss equation itself.
