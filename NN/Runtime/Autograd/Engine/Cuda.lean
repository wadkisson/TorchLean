# CUDA eager-engine backend

This umbrella collects the CUDA side of TorchLean's eager autograd engine.

The modules here are split by trust boundary by trust boundary:

- `Trusted` and `Buffer` expose the opaque FFI buffer type and allocation/copy primitives.
- `Kernels`, `ConvPool`, and `DGemm` declare native CUDA/CPU-stub kernel entrypoints.
- `Tape` and `Ops` build the CUDA reverse-mode tape over those buffers.
- `Float32Contract` and `KernelSpec` state the proof layer reference contracts for native bits.
- `NativeSources` documents which C/CUDA files implement the external symbols.

The compiled CUDA binary is a native trust boundary. Lean proves the pure specs and graph-level
connections around this boundary, while runtime tests validate the native implementation path.
