Trusted boundary for CUDA FFI.

Why this file exists:
- TorchLean’s repo policy forbids axioms in general library code.
- The CUDA runtime types are produced by external C/CUDA code, so we need a small trusted bridge
  to make them usable in compiled Lean code.

Everything in this module should be treated as part of the "FFI trust base".

# Trusted CUDA Runtime Boundary

This module contains the opaque CUDA buffer type used by the native runtime. Buffers are created by
explicit FFI allocation/copy functions. The nonemptiness witness below is only what Lean needs to
declare extern functions returning `Buffer`; it is not a default CUDA allocation and should not be
used as one.

/--
Opaque handle to a contiguous float32 buffer (CUDA device memory when built with `-K cuda=true`,
otherwise a CPU stub buffer).

Implementation:
- CUDA: `csrc/cuda/tensor/torchlean_cuda_tensor.cu`
- CPU stub (default `lake build`): `csrc/cuda/tensor/torchlean_cuda_tensor_stub.c`
-/
opaque BufferImpl : NonemptyType.{0}

/--
Runtime representation used for native CUDA buffer handles.

The `NonemptyType` wrapper is Lean's standard representation for external resources: it gives
extern declarations a nonempty result type while preserving reference-counting information in
compiled code. The underlying value is still created only by the native buffer constructors.

def Buffer : Type := BufferImpl.val

instance : Nonempty Buffer := BufferImpl.property
