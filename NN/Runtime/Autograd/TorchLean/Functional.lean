# Functional

TorchLean functional helpers in the style of `torch.*` building blocks.

These are derived ops built from the small primitive `TorchLean.Ops` surface, so eager execution and
compiled graph construction share the same model and loss definitions.

For background, see the PyTorch documentation for `torch.nn.functional`, `torch.autograd`, and
checkpointing, together with the standard reverse-mode AD references by Linnainmaa and by Griewank
and Walther.
