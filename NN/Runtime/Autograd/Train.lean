# Autograd Train

`NN.Runtime.Autograd.Train` is the curated umbrella for TorchLean's dynamic-tape training helpers.

This layer is about training-loop infrastructure, not model definitions:

- `Core` gives tagged errors plus typed value/gradient extraction from shape-erased tape data.
- `Dataset` gives pure, deterministic datasets/loaders with seeded shuffling.
- `Trainer` and `Logging` give small report/logging abstractions for example loops and tests.
- `Eval` averages reports over samples or batches while checking metric names.
- `TapeM` contains ergonomic tape-building helpers for params, constants, and mean losses.
- `TensorLoader` and `IoLoader` convert small in-memory/CSV/NPY datasets into typed tensors.
- `Optim` connects parameter tables, schedulers, and canonical optimizer equations.

The public model/training API in `NN.API.*` builds on these pieces. This umbrella exists so tests,
examples, and downstream users can import one stable training helper surface instead of memorizing
the internal file split.
