# IO loaders for training datasets

`NN.Runtime.Autograd.Train.IoLoader` is the public umbrella for file-backed training loaders.

The loader surface has three parts:

- `IoLoader.Common` contains small shared parser utilities and safety limits.
- `IoLoader.Csv` contains CSV-to-tensor dataset readers.
- `IoLoader.Npy` contains the supported NumPy `.npy` subset for vectors and matrices.

This umbrella keeps the import path stable while the parsing code stays close to the file format it
checks.
