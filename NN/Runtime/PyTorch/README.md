# PyTorch Interop (Runtime)

This folder contains TorchLean's bridge layer to and from PyTorch.

We use PyTorch for two practical reasons:

1. Execution and training: PyTorch is a practical runtime for trying models, training on real data,
   and checking that shapes and numerics behave as expected.
2. Moving artifacts: many workflows already produce PyTorch checkpoints or `state_dict`s. This
   bridge gives those parameters a path back into Lean for verification and proofs.

This is an interop layer, not a second semantics for TorchLean. PyTorch may produce code, weights,
graphs, or JSON artifacts, but TorchLean still parses the artifact, checks the shapes and supported
operators, and connects the result to TorchLean IR/spec objects. PyTorch autograd is not part of the
trusted proof boundary.

This is also distinct from the ATen/libtorch runtime path. ATen can be used as a fast forward kernel
provider in training, but TorchLean should still record the TorchLean graph/tape node and use
TorchLean's backward rule. The files here are about moving artifacts between PyTorch and Lean; they
do not hand model ownership or backward semantics to PyTorch.

## Export

`Export/` contains reusable exporters and adapters.

- `Export/Core.lean` holds shared string utilities and import/header rendering.
- `Export/IRPyTorch.lean` is the general model code path: it exports an `NN.IR.Graph` plus a
  parameter store into a standalone PyTorch module.
- `Export/ONNX.lean` emits a conservative Python adapter that reads an ONNX graph and writes the
  same `torchlean.ir.v1` JSON artifact used by the graph importer. It includes static-shape
  lowerings for common tensor ops plus Conv/Gemm/BatchNorm graph structure where the current IR can
  represent it.
- `Export/StateDict.lean` emits a Python adapter that converts a PyTorch checkpoint
  (`torch.save(model.state_dict(), ...)`, or common checkpoint wrappers) into TorchLean's
  shape checkable JSON format.
- `Export/TorchExport.lean` emits a Python adapter that captures a PyTorch `nn.Module` with
  `torch.export`/FX and writes TorchLean IR JSON for the supported op subset.

Reading map:

- Use `Export/Core.lean` for shared formatting helpers.
- Use `Export/StateDict.lean` when you already have PyTorch weights and need a model agnostic
  bridge into Lean readable JSON.
- Use `Export/TorchExport.lean` when you already have a PyTorch `nn.Module` and want to capture
  its tensor program into a TorchLean graph artifact.
- Use `Export/ONNX.lean` when you already have an ONNX graph and want a first-pass static graph
  lowering into the checked TorchLean IR artifact.
- Use `Export/IRPyTorch.lean` when you want a general `NN.IR.Graph` lowering path.

The exported Python code is ordinary runtime code. It is useful for debugging and comparison, but a
formal claim should name the Lean object that is checked after export: a parsed tensor bundle, a
validated IR graph, a certificate, or a theorem over the imported graph semantics.

## Import

`Import/` parses JSON encoded weights and graphs into TorchLean artifacts.

Why JSON? Python can write it directly, and Lean can parse it without depending on Python pickle
formats.

- `Import/Core.lean` defines `parseTensor`, which turns nested JSON arrays into a `Tensor Float s` when the JSON shape matches `s`.
  It also provides small error reporting wrappers (`loadWeightsE`, `getTensorE`) for debugging missing keys and shape mismatches.
- `Import/CrownParamstore.lean` bridges loaded tensors into the graph backend's `ParamStore` when a workflow needs node id keyed parameters.
- `Import/TorchExport.lean` parses TorchLean IR JSON from the generated graph capture adapter and
  accepts only graphs that pass the shared IR validators.

Reading map:

- Use `Import/Core.lean` for the generic JSON parsing path.
- Use `Import/TorchExport.lean` when you have a captured PyTorch graph JSON artifact.
- Use `Import/CrownParamstore.lean` when you already have typed tensors and need to assemble a `ParamStore`.

The importers reject unsupported structure early. That is a feature, not a limitation to paper over:
an unsupported PyTorch op should fail with a clear message instead of silently becoming an
uninterpreted node in a verification workflow.

## Examples live elsewhere

Architecture specific loaders and example round trips live under
`NN/Examples/Interop/PyTorch/{Export,Import}`. Runtime should not own model-family modules; it
should own the reusable bridge that examples, verification tools, and downstream projects can
share.

## What Users Can Do Today

- Export PyTorch weights to TorchLean readable JSON through the generated state dict adapter.
- Parse those JSON tensors in Lean with exact shape checks.
- Capture supported PyTorch `nn.Module` graphs as TorchLean IR JSON and validate them in Lean.
- Lower a conservative ONNX static graph fragment into the same TorchLean IR JSON path. Graph
  validation and payload loading stay separate: imported Conv/Gemm/BatchNorm structure can be
  checked as IR, while execution still needs the corresponding payload store.
- Reuse the Lean IR semantics after import. Elementwise ops, reshape/flatten/broadcast/sum, direct
  leading-axis concat plus generic concat through the shared evaluator, axis reductions, axis
  permutation, supported transpose forms, rank-2/3 matmul, softmax through the evaluator's
  axis-permutation path, and eval-mode NCHW BatchNorm now have theorem-level IR evaluator bridge
  facts. Payload-backed `linear`, no-dilation `conv2d`, payload-backed constants, and eval-mode
  NCHW BatchNorm are also covered at the actual one-step `Graph.evalAt` path as well as at their
  helper evaluators. CHW pooling has the same local bridge to its spec operations. LayerNorm is
  covered through the IR evaluator's reshape-to-2D `Spec.layerNorm` path, and graph-structural nodes
  such as input, detach, and scalar MSE are covered as well. The theorem import surface also
  includes an `Eval.Coverage` checkpoint listing the covered IR constructor families.
- Load supported verification model families such as PINNs/FNOs through the example interop loaders.
- Emit readable PyTorch code from a TorchLean `NN.IR.Graph` and `ParamStore`.

The trust boundary is explicit. PyTorch and CUDA kernels are external runtimes, and `.pt`/`.pth`
pickle/zip checkpoints are loaded on the Python side. TorchLean's checked object is the JSON
artifact it receives after export: tensor payloads with shapes, a supported graph structure, or a
verification artifact that Lean can parse and replay.
