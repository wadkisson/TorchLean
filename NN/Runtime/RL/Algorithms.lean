# RL Algorithm Equations

This umbrella collects the runtime layer equations for finite-action reinforcement-learning
algorithms:

- multi-armed bandits;
- tabular TD/SARSA/Q-learning updates;
- deep value-learning targets and scalar losses; and
- replay-minibatch DQN helpers; and
- categorical policy-gradient / PPO objectives.

These modules are "runtime" because they use TorchLean's typed tensor surface and executable scalar
classes, but they are still mostly pure mathematical equations. Environment IO, Gymnasium sessions,
rollout collection, and trust-boundary checks live outside this folder.
