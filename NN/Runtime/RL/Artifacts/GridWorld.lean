# GridWorld Run Artifacts (Umbrella)

Stable import for small GridWorld JSON artifacts used by TorchLean RL workflows and widgets. The
code is organized into:

- `Position`: shared `(row, col)` JSON helpers;
- `Policy`: before/after greedy policy snapshots;
- `Path`: before/after rollout trajectory snapshots.

Primitive Nat/String array codecs come from `Runtime.Training.JsonCodec`, so training logs and RL
artifacts share one JSON vocabulary.
