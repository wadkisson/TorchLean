# Mathematical Specifications

Import this file when you want TorchLean’s *spec* layer: shapes, tensors, layers, modules, and model
constructors.

If you're writing specs or proofs, this is usually the right place to start. If you're trying to
*run* models (autograd, training loops, import/export), use `NN.API` for the public application
interface or `NN.Runtime` for the complete executable subsystem.

Structure:
- `NN.Tensor.API` for the core tensor/shape layer and ergonomic constructors,
- `NN.Spec.Layers.*` for layer-level denotational semantics,
- `NN.Spec.Module.*` for PyTorch-style module wrappers over those specs,
- `NN.Spec.Models.*` for reusable model constructors,
- `NN.Spec.Autograd.*` / `NN.Spec.Dynamics.*` for auxiliary math-first interfaces.

This module imports the focused `NN.Spec.*` subsystems directly and re-exports `NN.Tensor` beside
them.
