# Shapes (`Spec.Shape`)

`Shape` is the type-level “shape descriptor” for tensors in the spec layer.

TorchLean uses *shape-indexed tensors*:

`Tensor α s`

so `Shape` is how we encode the structure of `s` in a way Lean can use for both computation and
proofs.

## Representation

`Shape` is an inductive tree:

- `.scalar`
- `.dim n s`  (a length-`n` dimension whose entries have shape `s`)

This matches the tensor definition in `NN/Spec/Core/Tensor/Core.lean`.

## Common utilities

- `Spec.Shape.size : Shape → Nat` is the total number of scalar elements (“numel”).
- `Shape.toList : Shape → List Nat` is a convenient runtime view used by front-ends and bridges.

PyTorch analogy:

- `Shape.toList s` corresponds to `tensor.shape` (a tuple of dimensions).
- `Spec.Shape.rank s` corresponds to `tensor.ndim`.
- `Spec.Shape.size s` corresponds to `tensor.numel()`.

## Broadcasting and axes

Broadcasting is encoded via `CanBroadcastTo` / `BroadcastTo`.

This is an intentionally *asymmetric* relation ("broadcast `s1` to `s2`"), because most tensor code
is naturally written by choosing the output shape and requiring each input to broadcast to it.

The typeclass wrapper `BroadcastTo` keeps higher-level specs readable: in many cases Lean can infer
the broadcast evidence automatically, so call sites don’t have to manually thread proofs around.

It also defines axis-validity helpers (`valid_axis`) and a `well_formed` predicate for “all
dimensions are positive”, which is useful when you want to rule out degenerate cases in proofs.

We represent shapes as an inductive tree instead of a bare `List Nat` because:

- it matches the tensor representation (`Tensor α s`) structurally, so many definitions are simple
  structural recursion,
- it keeps "scalar vs dim" cases explicit (important for proofs),
- it gives definitional equalities that are friendlier than lists in many places.

`Shape` is an outermost-first tree:

- `.dim n s` for a length-`n` dimension whose entries have shape `s`.

### Typeclass-friendly broadcasting (`BroadcastTo`)

The `CanBroadcastTo` relation is asymmetric (“broadcast `s₁` *to* `s₂`”), matching how most
operations are written: we pick a target shape and require each operand to broadcast to it.

The `BroadcastTo` wrapper lets Lean search for a broadcast proof automatically, which is convenient
for higher-level specs (layers/models) where the broadcasting details are not the point.

PyTorch analogy:

- PyTorch broadcasting aligns shapes from the *trailing* dimensions by implicitly prepending `1`s
  to the shorter shape.
- Our `Shape` is an outermost-first tree, so the corresponding operation is `expand_dims`:
  it inserts leading/outer dimensions to reach the target rank (this is the "prepend `1`s" step).
- `dim_1_to_n` corresponds to PyTorch's "dimension 1 can expand to n" rule.

### Friendly aliases (PyTorch-style)

We keep the canonical names (`toList`, `rank`, `size`, `well_formed`) because they show up
throughout the spec/proof code.

For docs and examples, these aliases read more like PyTorch.

    none
  else if !nodupBool perm then
    none
  else if !(perm.all (fun i => i < r)) then
    none
  else
    let dims := toList s
    -- `dims.length = r` by construction of `toList`/`rank`.
    let dims' := perm.map (fun i => getDim! dims i)
    some (ofList dims')

## Axis utilities

Why these exist:

- Reduction ops (`reduce_sum`, `reduce_mean`, etc.) need an axis argument.
- In executable code we want to reject invalid axes early, but in spec/proof code we want the axis
  validity to be available as evidence that can be carried through lemmas.

So we provide:
- `valid_axis axis s : Prop` as the core definition, and
- `valid_axis_inst axis s` as a typeclass wrapper so the common cases can be inferred.

PyTorch differences:

- PyTorch allows negative axes (e.g. `dim=-1`); here we use `Nat` axes only (0-based).
  A typical translation is: "last axis" = `Spec.Shape.rank s - 1` (when `rank s > 0`).

## Well-formedness (`well_formed`)

`well_formed s` means "all dimensions are positive".

Why this matters (and why we designed it this way):

- Many definitions use `Fin n` indexing; if `n = 0`, there is no index and you end up with either
  vacuous truths or extra cases that obscure the intent of the lemma.
- Some common ops become awkward or partial at `n = 0`. For example, a mean typically divides by
  the number of elements, so `n = 0` needs special-case semantics.
- PyTorch *does* allow zero-sized dimensions, and most ops define a sensible result for them. We
  intentionally keep that complexity out of the core spec layer because it makes proofs much more
  case-heavy. When we need zero-dimension tensors, we introduce them with explicit
  semantics instead of relying on incidental behavior.

This is a pragmatic choice: proofs and specs are shorter, and
runtime checks can still handle edge cases separately.

### Size positivity

If all dimensions of a shape are positive, then the total number of scalar elements is positive.

This is a small but useful bridge lemma: many reductions are only defined for nonempty dimensions,
and `WellFormed` is our standard way of expressing that assumption.

Typeclass wrapper for `Shape.well_formed`.

We use a typeclass (instead of passing a `well_formed` proof everywhere) because it mirrors how
other "side conditions" are handled in the library: call sites stay clean, and instances can be
provided locally (e.g. `letI : Shape.WellFormed s := ...`) when needed.
-/

  proof : s.wellFormed

-- Scalars are always well-formed.
/-- Scalars are always well-formed. -/

These small instances are purely about ergonomics.

In a lot of specs/examples we write shapes with concrete dimensions like `1` and `2` (bias vectors,
small CNN channels, etc.). Having `WellFormed` discharge automatically keeps call sites focused on
the math/model rather than on proof mechanics.

`validAxisLastAuto` is a convenience instance for the most common reduction axis:
"reduce over the last dimension".

In PyTorch this is `dim=-1` (after normalization). Here we stay in `Nat`, so the last axis is
`rank s - 1`, and we require `rank s > 0` plus well-formedness so the proof is meaningful.

Bridge lemma: turn a `valid_axis` proof into a `reducibleAlong` proof.

Why both exist:
- `valid_axis` is the semantic "this axis makes sense" predicate used in public APIs.
- `reducibleAlong` is a structurally convenient predicate for recursion over tensor shapes
  (it lines up with how `Tensor.dim` is constructed).

This function is the adapter between the two views.

/-- Convert a `valid_axis` proof into a structurally convenient `reducibleAlong` proof. -/

  match h with

`padLeft n s` prepends `n` singleton dimensions to a shape.

PyTorch analogy: `unsqueeze(0)` repeated `n` times (or equivalently viewing a tensor as having
extra leading dimensions of size 1). This is also the "prepend 1s" step you see in broadcasting.

| (n+1), s => dim 1 (padLeft n s)

-- Padding with leading `1`s increases rank by exactly `n`.
