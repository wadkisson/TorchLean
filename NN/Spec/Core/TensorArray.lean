# `TensorArray`: a simple array-backed tensor representation

`Spec.Tensor` is the canonical, shape-indexed tensor type for the spec layer. It is great for
proofs and pure definitions, but it is not always the most convenient representation for:

- IO (CSV/JSON/NPY),
- interop with external tooling,
- or performance-sensitive evaluation where you want explicit arrays.

`TensorArray.Tensor` is a finite-function representation:

- the shape is a runtime `List Nat`,
- the data is a flat `Array α`,
- and a proof field (`shape_valid`) records that the array length matches the shape product.

The bridge back to `Spec.Tensor` lives in `NN/Spec/Core/TensorBridge.lean`.

Why this representation exists:

- Most "paper definitions" are easiest with `Spec.Tensor` because shape correctness is enforced by
  types and proofs follow the inductive structure.
- Most integration tasks (file IO, external tools, or simple numerics) are easier with a flat
  array plus a runtime shape.
- Having both makes the trust boundaries explicit: array-backed tensors are convenient, while the
  shape-indexed tensors are the place we do most proofs.

namespace TensorArray

/--
  A tensor is represented as a flat array of elements and a shape (as a list of dimensions).
  The shape_valid proof ensures the array size matches the product of the shape dimensions.
-/
structure Tensor (α : Type) (shape : List Nat) where
  /-- Flat row-major data buffer. -/
  data : Array α
  /-- Proof that the buffer length matches the product of the runtime dimensions. -/
  shape_valid : data.size = shape.foldl (· * ·) 1

/--
Product of dimensions for a runtime shape list.

This is the runtime analogue of `Spec.Shape.size` for `Spec.Shape`.
We keep it as a `def` (not just a local `let`) because it appears everywhere
`shape_valid` is constructed or rewritten.
-/
def shapeProd (shape : List Nat) : Nat := shape.foldl (· * ·) 1

/--
Build a tensor from an array when you already have a size proof.

Design choice:
- `Tensor` stores the shape at the type level (`Tensor α shape`), so callers must provide
  `h : arr.size = shapeProd shape`.
- This makes "I reshaped / reinterpreted the data" a conscious action with an explicit proof.
-/
def ofArray {α : Type} (arr : Array α) (shape : List Nat) (h : arr.size = shapeProd shape) : Tensor
  α shape :=
  { data := arr, shape_valid := h }

/-- Base case for `shapeProd`: the empty shape has product `1`. -/
@[simp]
theorem shapeProd_nil : shapeProd [] = 1 := rfl

/--
Helper lemma: factoring a left-multiplication out of the `foldl` product.

This is used to prove `shapeProd_cons` and similar "shape product algebra" facts.
-/

/--
Length of `List.zipWith` is the minimum of the input lengths.

We keep these small list lemmas local to this file because they are only needed to justify
`shape_valid` proofs for array operations like `zipWith`.
-/
theorem List.length_zipWith {α β γ : Type} (f : α → β → γ) (l1 : List α) (l2 : List β) :

theorem List.length_map {α β : Type} (f : α → β) (l : List α) :
  (l.map f).length = l.length := by

/--
Length of `flatten` is the sum of lengths of each inner list.

This kind of fact comes up any time we build an `Array`/`List` by flattening a list-of-lists.
-/

  ll.flatten.length = (ll.map List.length).sum := by

def flatIndex (shape : List Nat) (indices : List Nat) : Option Nat :=
  flatIndexAux shape indices 0

/--
`flatIndexAux` returns an index that is bounded by the "mixed-radix" size implied by the
remaining `shape`.

Intuition: starting with accumulator `acc`, the recursion computes something of the form
`acc * shapeProd shape + tail`, where `tail < shapeProd shape`.

/--
Get an element at the given multi-index.

Returns `none` if:
- the rank mismatches, or
- any index is out of bounds.

This is the array-backed analogue of `Spec.get_spec`.

/--
Map a function over all elements (shape preserved).

The only subtlety is the `shape_valid` proof: mapping doesn't change array length.
-/
def map {α β : Type} {shape : List Nat} (f : α → β) (t : Tensor α shape) : Tensor β shape :=

      rw [t.shape_valid] }

/--
Elementwise binary operation (shape preserved).

We require both tensors to have the same `shape` at the type level, so shape mismatches are
unrepresentable here.
-/
def map2 {α β γ : Type} {shape : List Nat}
  (f : α → β → γ) (t₁ : Tensor α shape) (t₂ : Tensor β shape) : Tensor γ shape :=

      exact Nat.min_self _ }

/--
Reduce by summing all elements (flattened).

This ignores the tensor's rank and sums over `data` directly.
PyTorch analogy: `t.sum()` (over all axes).
-/
def sum {α : Type} [Add α] [Zero α] {shape : List Nat} (t : Tensor α shape) : α :=
  t.data.toList.foldl (· + ·) 0

/--
Reshape a tensor to a new shape with the same number of elements.

This is "view"-style: it reuses the same underlying `data` array.
The proof `h` is the only thing that changes.
-/
def reshape {α : Type} {shape1 shape2 : List Nat}
  (t : Tensor α shape1) (h : shapeProd shape1 = shapeProd shape2) : Tensor α shape2 :=
  { data := t.data

      exact Eq.trans t.shape_valid h }

/--
Create a tensor filled with a constant value.

PyTorch analogy: `torch.full(shape, val)`.
-/
def full {α : Type} (shape : List Nat) (val : α) : Tensor α shape :=
  { data := Array.replicate (shape.foldl (· * ·) 1) val
    shape_valid := by simp [Array.size_replicate] }

/-- Elementwise multiplication. -/
def mul {α : Type} [Mul α] {shape : List Nat} (t₁ t₂ : Tensor α shape) : Tensor α shape :=
  map2 (· * ·) t₁ t₂

/--
ReLU activation (elementwise max with zero).

This is written in the simplest "executable" style: a branch on `x > 0`.
For interval/real semantics, use `Spec` layer ops; this module is for array-backed computations.
-/

/--
Matrix-vector multiplication: (m x n) matrix times (n) vector gives (m) vector.

This is a direct reference implementation intended for small sizes and clarity.
If you need performance, you generally want the runtime/TorchLean path instead.
