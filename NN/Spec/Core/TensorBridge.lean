# TensorBridge

Computable, row-major conversions between `TensorArray.Tensor` and `Spec.Tensor`.

Why we have this file:

- `Spec.Tensor` is the *spec* representation (functional, shape-indexed).
- `TensorArray.Tensor` is an *array-backed* representation that is convenient for IO and external
  interfaces (CSV/NPY/etc).

This bridge gives explicit, easy-to-audit conversions:

- `flatten` / `unflatten` between `Spec.Tensor` and a flat row-major list,
- plus shape list conversions (`Shape ↔ List Nat`) to connect the typed and runtime views.

## Why “row-major”?

Our spec tensor datatype is a nested `dim` tree: outer dimensions are modeled as functions
`Fin n → ...`. Our `flatten` recursion iterates outer indices first and then recurses inward, so
the **last axis varies fastest** (the conventional row-major / C-order layout for matrices and
images when you think of the outer dimension as “rows”).

We could have picked a different order, but we need one consistent convention for interop (CSV/NPY,
torch tensor serialization, etc.). Row-major matches the contiguous layout assumptions used in many
toolchains, so it’s a practical default.

## Notes for proofs

We don’t want “conversion code” to be a place where meaning quietly changes. So we prove the basic
round-trip facts:

- flattening after unflattening gives you the original list, and
- unflattening after flattening gives you the original tensor.

Those lemmas let us move between the functional spec view and the array/list view without
handwaving.

Example file: `NN.Examples.DeepDives.Tensor.TensorBridge`.

References / analogies:
- Row-major ("C-order") is the default contiguous layout in many toolchains (NumPy/PyTorch) and is a
  common convention for serialization. This file fixes a single convention so interop is
  auditably well-defined.
