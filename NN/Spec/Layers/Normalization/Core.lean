# Normalization layers (spec layer)

This file collects a few normalization operators used throughout TorchLean's spec/model code.

The common pattern is:

- compute per-axis statistics (mean / variance or RMS),
- normalize with an `epsilon` for numerical stability,
- optionally apply an affine transform (`gamma`, `beta`) like PyTorch does.

Forward-mode JVP for `layerNorm`.

For each sequence position, LayerNorm is the map
`y = gamma ⊙ xhat + beta` with `xhat = (x - mean(x)) / sqrt(var(x)+eps)`.
The input tangent is normalized by the standard closed form

`dxhat = inv_std ⊙ (dx - mean(dx) - xhat ⊙ mean(dx ⊙ xhat))`,

and affine-parameter tangents contribute `xhat ⊙ dgamma + dbeta`. This is the forward-mode
counterpart of the closed-form VJP above and follows the same clamped-variance convention as the
forward pass.

  Group Normalization

GroupNorm for channel-last tensors `(batch, height, width, channels)`.

PyTorch analogy: `torch.nn.GroupNorm(num_groups=groups, num_channels=channels)` applied per sample.
The mean/variance are computed over *both* the spatial dimensions and the channels within each
group, then an affine transform is applied per channel via `gamma` and `beta`.

This operator is useful in settings where BatchNorm's dependence on batch statistics is awkward
(small batches, verification, or when you want purely per-sample behavior).
