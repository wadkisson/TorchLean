# Selective scan specs

This file contains the small proof layer core behind state-space sequence models such as S4 and
Mamba.

The key observation, used by Mamba's hardware-aware parallel scan, is that each per-token recurrent
update can be viewed as an affine map

`h ↦ A_t h + b_t`.

Affine maps compose associatively.  A recurrent scan can therefore be implemented either by a
left-to-right recurrence or by a parallel prefix scan over affine summaries.  The scalar definitions
below are kept compact so that `NN/MLTheory/Proofs/StateSpace/Scan.lean` can prove the algebra
without depending on a particular runtime backend.  The diagonal tensor definitions are the direct
TorchLean spec analogue used by the model and CUDA contracts.

def id [One α] [Zero α] : ScalarAffineTransition α :=
  { a := 1, b := 0 }

/--
Compose two affine transitions.

`compose t₂ t₁` means "first apply `t₁`, then apply `t₂`".

    ScalarAffineTransition α :=

  | [] => h0
  | tr :: rest => runScalarAffine (tr.apply h0) rest

/--
Summarize a transition list as one affine transition.

This is the algebraic payload used by parallel selective scan: prefix summaries can be produced by
any associative scan algorithm, and applying the summary to `h0` is equivalent to recurrence.

Compose diagonal affine transitions channelwise.

The order is the same as `ScalarAffineTransition.compose`: `compose t₂ t₁` is first `t₁`, then `t₂`.
