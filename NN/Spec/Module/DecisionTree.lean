# Decision Trees

Pure decision tree datatype and evaluator. This is a standalone non-neural baseline, so it does not
use the tensor/module APIs.

Why include it here?

- It serves as a non-neural reference baseline for experiments (e.g. mixed pipelines).
- The datatype is direct enough to use in proofs or examples without pulling in tensor machinery.

If you're thinking in the Python ecosystem: this is not an `nn.Module`-style component. It is
closer to a symbolic scikit-learn style decision tree, except we keep it fully pure and explicit.
