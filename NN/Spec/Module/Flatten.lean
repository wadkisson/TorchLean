# Flatten module wrapper

`flatten_spec` converts a tensor of shape `s` into a vector of length `Spec.Shape.size s`.

Why is the output length computed at the type level?

- It reflects the spec contract: flattening is just a re-indexing, so the number of elements is
  determined entirely by the input shape.
- It prevents a common class of downstream mistakes (e.g. wiring a linear layer with the wrong
  feature dimension).

If you're thinking in PyTorch: this is `nn.Flatten()` in its simplest form (collapse all dims).

-- Flatten module specification wrapper
/-- Wrap `flatten_spec` as an `NNModuleSpec` (`s -> (Spec.Shape.size s)`).

The `dimensions` metadata field is not meaningful for flatten because the output length depends on
the whole input shape; exporters should recompute the shape from the typed input.
