# `NN/Spec`: Specification Layer

This folder is TorchLean's specification layer. It holds the reference definitions of tensors,
operations, layers, models, dynamics, and RL objects that later runtime and verification code point
back to.

The same spec can be instantiated in several scalar worlds:

- `ℝ` for clean mathematical statements;
- `FP32`/`NeuralFloat` for rounded-real proof models;
- `IEEE32Exec` for executable binary32 semantics;
- runtime scalar backends where explicit bridges state what is assumed.

The practical goal is to avoid a gap between the network we run and the network we reason about:
define the reference behavior once, then make runtime, graph, and verifier layers say how they
connect back to it.

Ordinary model/training code should start from `import NN`. Use `NN.Spec` when a file is
spec-focused and should avoid importing the full public API.

## How To Navigate

- `Core/`
  - `Shape.lean`: type-level tensor shapes, axis utilities, and broadcasting evidence.
  - `Context.lean`: `Context α`, the numeric backend interface for spec code.
  - `Tensor/Core.lean`: the `Spec.Tensor` datatype.
  - `TensorOps.lean`, `TensorReductionShape.lean`: elementwise ops, reductions, reshapes,
    broadcasts, concat/slice, and axis manipulation.
  - `Complex.lean`, `TensorBridge.lean`, `TensorGrad.lean`: FFT/FNO support, runtime bridges, and
    gradient helper specs.
- `Layers/`: forward and backward specs for common layers: linear, convolution, attention,
  FlashAttention-style fused attention, normalization, pooling, embeddings, recurrent layers,
  selective scan, dropout, and losses.
- `Autograd/`: spec-level reverse-mode building blocks (`OpSpec`) used by runtime AD wrappers and
  proof files.
- `Module/`: module records that package layer specs with input/output shapes and export metadata.
- `Models/`: model compositions such as MLP, CNN, Transformer, ResNet, ViT, Seq2Seq, UNet, GNN,
  linear/logistic regression, gradient boosted trees, HMM/GMM/PCA, and state-space models.
- `Dynamics/`: pure dynamical-system and state-space recurrence specs.
- `RL/`: Bellman backups, returns, MDPs, Gymnasium-style environment contracts, and GridWorld specs.
- `NN/Examples/`: executable examples that exercise the specs through the public trainer and CLI.

## Terminology

- spec = pure reference definitions in this folder.
- runtime = tape/graph execution, compilation, CUDA paths, and training loops (see `NN/Runtime/*` and
  `NN.Runtime`).
- verification = bound propagation, certificate checking, and artifact replay (see `NN/Verification/*` and
  `NN.Verification`).

## What A Spec Claim Means

A spec definition is the reference object for later layers. Runtime backends, external kernels, and
serialized artifacts connect to it through explicit lowering, checking, or trust-boundary statements.
The usual chain is:

1. define the mathematical behavior here,
2. execute or lower a runtime object elsewhere,
3. state a bridge, checker, test, or theorem connecting the runtime/artifact back to the spec.

This distinction matters for common ML conventions. For example, boolean attention masks always use
the hard-mask meaning: blocked positions contribute exactly zero softmax numerator. An additive
attention bias is a different operation and must not be used as an approximation to that mask.
Similarly, a real-valued layer spec, an executable `IEEE32Exec` path, and
a CUDA `Float32` kernel are related objects, not interchangeable words.

When adding a new spec, keep the reference behavior small and explicit. Put runtime shortcuts,
foreign-library assumptions, tolerances, and file-format details in the runtime, verification, or
trust-boundary layer that actually owns them.
