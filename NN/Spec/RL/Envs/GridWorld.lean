# GridWorld (Lean-native finite RL environment)

This file defines a small deterministic **GridWorld** environment in TorchLean’s *spec* layer,
along with two induced “MDP views”:

- a `Spec.RL.Env` view with explicit latent state,
- a `Spec.RL.FiniteMDP` view (deterministic finite-state discounted MDP),
- and a `Spec.RL.FiniteStochastic.MDP` view where transitions are represented as **one-hot**
  row-stochastic kernels.

This is intended as a Lean-native testbed for RL algorithm development and proofs: small enough
to be pleasant to reason about, but shaped like the objects used in standard RL theory.

## State and Action Types

We use a **coordinate** state `(row, col)` rather than a flattened index. This keeps the
environment’s definition close to the textbook picture and makes “stays in bounds” properties
stateable directly.

The `FiniteMDP` / `FiniteStochastic.MDP` views flatten `(row, col)` to `Fin (height * width)` using
mathlib’s canonical equivalence `Fin height × Fin width ≃ Fin (height * width)`.
-/

/-- A grid position `(row, col)` in a `height × width` grid. -/
abbrev GridPos (width height : Nat) : Type := Fin height × Fin width

/-- Discrete actions for a 4-neighborhood grid: `0=up`, `1=down`, `2=left`, `3=right`. -/
abbrev GridAction : Type := Fin 4

namespace GridAction

/-- Grid action that decreases the row coordinate. -/
def up : GridAction := ⟨0, by decide⟩

/-- Grid action that increases the row coordinate. -/
def down : GridAction := ⟨1, by decide⟩

/-- Grid action that decreases the column coordinate. -/
def left : GridAction := ⟨2, by decide⟩

/-- Grid action that increases the column coordinate. -/
def right : GridAction := ⟨3, by decide⟩

end GridAction

## Environment Dynamics

Dynamics are deterministic and border-clamped:
- attempting to move outside the grid keeps the coordinate unchanged.

Reward / termination scheme:
- If the agent is already at the goal, the environment remains terminal (`terminated = true`)
  and yields reward `0`.
- Otherwise, a step yields reward `0` iff the successor state is the goal, and reward `-1`
  otherwise. The `terminated` flag matches “successor is goal”.
- `truncated` is always `false` (no time-limit semantics in this environment).

## Finite-state MDP Views

To connect GridWorld to TorchLean’s finite discounted MDP layer we flatten the coordinate state:

`Fin height × Fin width ≃ Fin (height * width)`.

This is the standard row-major encoding used throughout mathlib.
-/

/-- Flatten a `(row,col)` grid coordinate into `Fin (height * width)`. -/
def encode (pos : State width height) : Fin (height * width) :=
  (finProdFinEquiv (m := height) (n := width)) pos

/-- Unflatten a `Fin (height * width)` state index into a `(row,col)` grid coordinate. -/
def decode (i : Fin (height * width)) : State width height :=
  (finProdFinEquiv (m := height) (n := width)).symm i

/-- Deterministic finite-state discounted MDP view of GridWorld. -/
def toFiniteMDP (gw : GridWorld width height) : FiniteMDP ℝ (height * width) 4 :=
  { initialState := encode (width := width) (height := height) gw.start
    step := fun state action =>
      let out := gw.step (decode (width := width) (height := height) state) action
      { state := encode (width := width) (height := height) out.state
        reward := out.reward
        terminated := out.terminated
        truncated := out.truncated }
    discount := gw.discount }

/-- One-hot transition kernel for a deterministic next state. -/
def oneHot (next : Fin (height * width)) : Tensor ℝ (.dim (height * width) .scalar) :=
  Tensor.dim (fun i => Tensor.scalar (if i = next then (1 : ℝ) else 0))

/-- Finite-stochastic MDP view of GridWorld where `P(. | s,a)` is a one-hot row. -/
def toFiniteStochasticMDP (gw : GridWorld width height) : FiniteStochastic.MDP (height * width) 4 :=
  { initialState := (toFiniteMDP (width := width) (height := height) gw).initialState
    transitionProb := fun state action =>
      let out := (toFiniteMDP (width := width) (height := height) gw).step state action
      oneHot (width := width) (height := height) out.state
    reward := fun state action =>
      ((toFiniteMDP (width := width) (height := height) gw).step state action).reward
    terminated := fun state action =>
      ((toFiniteMDP (width := width) (height := height) gw).step state action).terminated
    discount := gw.discount }
