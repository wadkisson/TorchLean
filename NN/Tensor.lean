# Tensors

Curated umbrella import for TorchLean's core tensor/shape API.

Use this import for tensor literals, shape aliases, dynamic tensors, and small executable tensor
helpers. `NN.Tensor.API` remains the implementation leaf; downstream users should use either `NN`
for the complete library, `NN.API` for application code, or `NN.Tensor` for this layer alone.
