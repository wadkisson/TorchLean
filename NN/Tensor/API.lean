# Tensor API Implementation

User-facing tensor API for TorchLean.

This is the implementation leaf behind the public `NN.Tensor` umbrella. It is the ergonomic layer
that sits on top of the spec-first tensor semantics in `NN.Spec.*`. It does not introduce new math;
it provides constructors and syntax intended for examples, tests, compact models, and introductory examples.

Typical responsibilities here:

- arbitrary-rank shapes represented by `Spec.Shape`,
- friendly constructors from lists and literals,
- small syntax helpers for examples/tests,
- and printing support for runtime-friendly dtypes.

Notation policy:
- keep compact literal constructors (`shape!`, `tensor!`, `tensorOfList!`, `tensorF!`, `tensor32!`,
  `fin!`) in this module so they are easy to find and do not leak into unrelated imports,
- keep more semantic glyphs scoped when possible (as in `NN.IR` and `NN.Floats.IEEEExec`),
- and prefer namespace-local aliases over reusing the same unscoped token in multiple layers.

Lean is statically typed, so the element type usually plays the role of “dtype”:

  `let x := NN.Tensor.vector (α := Float) [0.1, 0.2]`
  `let q := NN.Tensor.vector (α := ℚ) [1, 2]`

If you ever see `Tensor Float _` in code: the `_` is just “let Lean infer the shape from the RHS”.
In examples we prefer to omit the type annotation entirely unless it helps readability.

For convenience, this module also provides constructors that start from `Float` literals and cast
into common backends such as `IEEE32Exec`.

Printing: for `Tensor ℝ` we intentionally refuse to pretty-print, since that backend is meant for
proof-oriented mathematics rather than runtime IO. Use `Float`, `IEEE32Exec`, `ℚ`, etc. for values
you actually want to display.

namespace NN.Tensor

open Spec

/-- Local alias for the canonical spec shape type. -/
abbrev Shape := Spec.Shape

/-! ## Scalar extraction -/

/--
Extract the scalar value from a scalar-shaped tensor.

PyTorch comparison: like `t.item()` for a 0-dim tensor.
-/
def scalarOf {α : Type} (t : Spec.Tensor α Spec.Shape.scalar) : α :=
  match t with
  | .scalar v => v

/--
Dot-notation sugar for scalar tensors: `t.item`.

This is defined at the `Spec.Tensor` namespace so that it works with the canonical tensor type.
-/
abbrev _root_.Spec.Tensor.item {α : Type} (t : Spec.Tensor α Spec.Shape.scalar) : α :=
  NN.Tensor.scalarOf t

/-- `Tensor.scalar x` round-trips through `Spec.Tensor.item`. -/
@[simp] theorem _root_.Spec.Tensor.item_scalar {α : Type} (x : α) :
    (Spec.Tensor.scalar x).item = x := rfl

/-! ## Construction -/

/-- Convert a runtime list of dimensions like `[2, 3, 4]` into a nested `Shape`.

Why this exists:
- In the spec layer we usually *carry the shape in the type* (great for safety).
- In “API land” we often start from lists (CLI args, JSON, compact examples, …).

`shapeOfDims` is the bridge between those representations.
-/
@[reducible] def shapeOfDims : List Nat → Shape
  | [] => .scalar
  | n :: ns => .dim n (shapeOfDims ns)

/-- `shapeOfDims` round-trips through `Spec.Shape.toList`. -/
@[simp] theorem shapeOfDims_toList (s : Spec.Shape) :
    shapeOfDims (_root_.Spec.Shape.toList s) = s := by
  induction s with
  | scalar => rfl
  | dim n rest ih =>
      simp [_root_.Spec.Shape.toList, shapeOfDims, ih]

/-- Number of scalar elements (“numel”) implied by a runtime `dims` list. -/
def numelDims (dims : List Nat) : Nat :=
  Spec.Shape.size (shapeOfDims dims)

/-- Create a 1-D tensor from a Lean `List`.

Notes:
- The shape is computed from `xs.length`, so the type remembers the length.
- This is total and does not perform any runtime checks.

PyTorch analogy: `torch.tensor(xs)` producing a 1D tensor.
-/
def vector (α : Type := Float) (xs : List α) :
    Spec.Tensor α (.dim xs.length .scalar) :=
  Spec.vectorFromList xs

/-! ### One-hot vectors -/

/-- One-hot vector of length `n`, with a single `1` at index `k`. -/
def oneHot {α : Type} [Zero α] [One α] (n : Nat) (k : Fin n) :
    Spec.Tensor α (.dim n .scalar) :=
  Spec.Tensor.dim (fun i => Spec.Tensor.scalar (if decide (i = k) then (1 : α) else 0))

/-- One-hot vector using a raw `Nat` index.

If `k ≥ n`, we return the all-zeros vector instead of failing.
This is convenient in data-conversion code where carrying a `Fin n` would obscure the caller.
-/
def oneHotNat {α : Type} [Zero α] [One α] (n k : Nat) : Spec.Tensor α (.dim n .scalar) :=
  if h : k < n then
    oneHot (α := α) n ⟨k, h⟩
  else
    Spec.fill (0 : α) (.dim n .scalar)

/-- 2-D tensor from nested lists, returning `none` for empty/ragged inputs.

This delegates to `Spec.from_list_2d`, which refuses:
- an empty outer list,
- any empty row,
- or rows with mismatched lengths.

PyTorch analogy: `torch.tensor(xss)` also refuses ragged inputs.
-/
def matrix? (α : Type := Float) [Inhabited α] (xss : List (List α)) :
    Option (Spec.Tensor α (.dim xss.length
      (.dim (if xss.isEmpty then 0 else xss.head!.length) .scalar)))
      :=
  Spec.matrixFromRows xss

/-- 2-D tensor from nested lists, with a clear error message on failure. -/
def matrix (α : Type := Float) [Inhabited α] (xss : List (List α)) :
    Except String (Spec.Tensor α (.dim xss.length
      (.dim (if xss.isEmpty then 0 else xss.head!.length) .scalar))) :=
  match matrix? (α := α) xss with
  | some t => .ok t
  | none => .error "matrix: empty or ragged nested lists"

/-! ### Ragged-friendly 2D constructors -/

/-- 2-D tensor from nested lists, padding/truncating each row to `nCols`.

This is the permissive sibling of `matrix`: it never fails, but it will silently pad with
`default` (and drop extra entries beyond `nCols`). This is useful when you *intend* ragged inputs
(e.g. batching variable-length sequences after padding).

PyTorch analogy: closer to `pad_sequence(..., batch_first=True)` followed by `torch.tensor`.
-/
def matrixPadTo (α : Type := Float) [Inhabited α] (nCols : Nat) (xss : List (List α)) :
    Spec.Tensor α (.dim xss.length (.dim nCols .scalar)) :=
  Spec.matrixFromRowsPadTo (nCols := nCols) xss

/-- 2-D tensor from nested lists, padding to the maximum row length (`0` if empty).

This is convenient when you just want a rectangular tensor without precomputing `nCols`. -/
def matrixPadRight (α : Type := Float) [Inhabited α] (xss : List (List α)) :
    Spec.Tensor α (.dim xss.length (.dim (Spec.maxRowLength xss) .scalar)) :=
  Spec.matrixFromRowsPadRight xss

/-! ### General N-D tensors from a flat list -/

/-!
The “real” spec constructors are shape-indexed, i.e. you usually build tensors by recursion on a
`Shape`. In example and data-loading code, though, it’s common to have:

- a runtime dims list (`List Nat`), and
- a flat list of scalars.

So we do a small amount of reshaping here.

Implementation note:
- `buildFromFlat_ofLenEq` consumes the flat list using a proof that lengths match.
- The public APIs (`ofListOfLength` and `ofList`) are the ones that establish that proof.
-/
/--
Build a shape-indexed tensor from a flat list, given a proof that the lengths match.

This is a helper for `ofListOfLength`/`ofList`: users typically want those APIs rather than
recursing over `Shape` directly.
-/
def buildFromFlatOfLenEq {α : Type} :
    (s : Shape) → (xs : List α) → xs.length = Spec.Shape.size s → Spec.Tensor α s
  | .scalar, xs, h => by
      have hx : xs.length = 1 := by
        have h' := h
        simp [Spec.Shape.size] at h'
        exact h'
      have h0 : 0 < xs.length := by
        simp [hx]
      exact Spec.Tensor.scalar (xs.get ⟨0, h0⟩)
  | .dim n s', xs, h => by
      let chunkSize : Nat := Spec.Shape.size s'
      have hxLen : xs.length = n * chunkSize := by
        have h' := h
        simp [Spec.Shape.size] at h'
        dsimp [chunkSize]
        exact h'
      refine Spec.Tensor.dim (fun i => ?_)
      let start : Nat := i.val * chunkSize
      let chunk : List α := (xs.drop start).take chunkSize
      have hAdd : start + chunkSize ≤ xs.length := by
        have hMul : (i.val + 1) * chunkSize ≤ n * chunkSize :=
          Nat.mul_le_mul_right chunkSize (Nat.succ_le_of_lt i.2)
        have : i.val * chunkSize + chunkSize ≤ n * chunkSize := by
          simpa [Nat.add_mul] using hMul
        simpa [hxLen, start] using this
      have hStartLe : start ≤ xs.length :=
        Nat.le_trans (Nat.le_add_right start chunkSize) hAdd
      have hChunkSub : chunkSize ≤ xs.length - start := by
        have hAdd' : chunkSize + start ≤ xs.length := by
          simpa [Nat.add_comm] using hAdd
        exact (Nat.le_sub_iff_add_le hStartLe).2 hAdd'
      have hChunkLen : chunk.length = chunkSize := by
        simp [chunk, List.length_take, List.length_drop, Nat.min_eq_left hChunkSub]
      have hChunkLen' : chunk.length = Spec.Shape.size s' := by
        simpa [chunkSize] using hChunkLen
      exact buildFromFlatOfLenEq (s := s') (xs := chunk) hChunkLen'

/-- N-D tensor from a runtime `dims` list and a flat `xs`, given a proof of matching length.

This is the “static / proof-carrying” version: if you can prove the length match, you avoid any
runtime checks and you keep a precise shape in the type.
-/
def ofListOfLength {α : Type} (dims : List Nat) (xs : List α)
    (h : xs.length = numelDims dims) : Spec.Tensor α (shapeOfDims dims) :=
  buildFromFlatOfLenEq (α := α) (s := shapeOfDims dims) (xs := xs) (by
    simpa [numelDims] using h)

/-- N-D tensor from a runtime `dims` list and a flat `xs`, with a runtime length check.

This is the “dynamic / user-friendly” version: it fails with a descriptive message if the number
of provided scalars doesn’t match the implied `numel`.
-/
def ofList {α : Type} (dims : List Nat) (xs : List α) :
    Except String (Spec.Tensor α (shapeOfDims dims)) :=
  let expected := numelDims dims
  if h : xs.length = expected then
    .ok (ofListOfLength (α := α) (dims := dims) (xs := xs) h)
  else
    .error s!"ofList: expected {expected} elements for dims={dims}, got {xs.length}"

/-! ### Fill, zeros, and ones from runtime dimensions -/

/-- Fill a tensor from a runtime dimension list.

The `OfDims` suffix distinguishes this constructor from `Spec.fill`, whose second argument is an
already-typed `Shape`.
-/
def fillOfDims {α : Type} (value : α) (dims : List Nat) : Spec.Tensor α (shapeOfDims dims) :=
  Spec.fill value (shapeOfDims dims)

/-- All-zeros tensor, from a runtime `dims` list. -/
def zerosOfDims {α : Type} [Zero α] (dims : List Nat) : Spec.Tensor α (shapeOfDims dims) :=
  fillOfDims (α := α) 0 dims

/-- All-ones tensor, from a runtime `dims` list. -/
def onesOfDims {α : Type} [One α] (dims : List Nat) : Spec.Tensor α (shapeOfDims dims) :=
  fillOfDims (α := α) 1 dims

/-! ## Tactics -/

/-!
`ofListOfLength` needs a proof that your flat list has the right length.

For the common “all dimensions and lists are literals/abbrevs” case, this tactic
usually closes that goal automatically.

Usage:
  `ofListOfLength ... (by tensor_len)`
-/
macro "tensor_len" : tactic =>
  `(tactic| first
    | (simp [NN.Tensor.numelDims, NN.Tensor.shapeOfDims, Spec.Shape.size]; dsimp; decide)
    | decide
    | simp [NN.Tensor.numelDims, NN.Tensor.shapeOfDims, Spec.Shape.size])

/-!
`tensorOfList!` is the checked literal constructor for constants whose length proof should be solved
by `tensor_len`.

It expands to `ofListOfLength ... (by tensor_len)`, so you usually don’t have to write the proof.
If the proof can’t be solved (e.g. truly dynamic `dims`), elaboration fails; use `ofList` in that
  case.
-/
macro "tensorOfList!" dims:term:max xs:term:max : term =>
  `(NN.Tensor.ofListOfLength (dims := $dims) (xs := $xs) (by tensor_len))

/--
Typed variant of `tensorOfList!`.

This is the same constructor as `tensorOfList! dims xs`, but lets you explicitly specify the element
type when numeric literals would otherwise default to an undesired type.

Example:
`def x : Tensor ℚ (shape![2, 2]) := tensorOfList! (ty := ℚ) [2, 2] [1, 2, 3, 4]`

Implementation note: we avoid reserving a common identifier as a syntax keyword (Lean would then
treat it as a keyword in downstream files). Instead, we parse an `ident` and check that it is
`ty`.
-/
macro "tensorOfList!" "(" name:ident ":=" elemTy:term ")" dims:term:max xs:term:max : term => do
  if name.getId != `ty then
    Lean.Macro.throwErrorAt name "tensorOfList!: expected `(ty := <type>)`"
  `(NN.Tensor.ofListOfLength (α := $elemTy) (dims := $dims) (xs := $xs) (by tensor_len))

/-!
`shape!` is a compact convenience macro for examples: build a `Shape` from a bracketed dimension list.

It expands through reducible `shapeOfDims`, so it stays definitionally aligned with `tensorOfList!`
while still unfolding for dependent proofs and shape typeclass search.

Example:
  `def s : Shape := shape![2, 3, 4]`
-/
syntax (name := shapeBang) "shape!" "[" term,* "]" : term

macro_rules
  | `(shape![ $ds:term,* ]) =>
      `(NN.Tensor.shapeOfDims [ $ds,* ])

/-!
`tensor!` is the "nested brackets" constructor, similar to writing nested Python lists in PyTorch.

Examples:

```lean
-- shape (2, 3, 4)
def x :=
  tensor! [
    [ [0,1,2,3],   [4,5,6,7],   [8,9,10,11] ],
    [ [12,13,14,15],[16,17,18,19],[20,21,22,23] ]
  ]
```

It is fully general over rank: the nesting depth determines the rank.
Internally, it computes the dims from list lengths and flattens in row-major order
(last dimension changes fastest), then calls `tensorOfList!`.

If you need runtime/ragged handling, use `ofList`/`dynamicOfList` instead.
-/

  | _ =>

      pure ([], [t])

end TensorLit

/-!
Typed variant of `tensor!`.

This is useful when the leaf literals don’t uniquely determine the element type.

Example:
```lean
def x : Tensor ℚ (shape![2, 2]) :=
  tensor! (ty := ℚ) [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
```
-/

macro "tensor!" "(" name:ident ":=" elemTy:term ")" xs:term:max : term => do
  if name.getId != `ty then
    Lean.Macro.throwErrorAt name "tensor!: expected `(ty := <type>)`"
  let (dims, flat) ← TensorLit.parseNested xs
  let dimsElems : Array (TSyntax `term) :=
    dims.toArray.map (fun n => ⟨Syntax.mkNumLit (toString n)⟩)
  let flatElems : Array (TSyntax `term) :=
    flat.toArray.map (fun stx => ⟨stx⟩)
  let dimsSep := Syntax.TSepArray.ofElems (sep := ",") dimsElems
  let flatSep := Syntax.TSepArray.ofElems (sep := ",") flatElems
  let dimsTerm ← `(term| [$(dimsSep),*])
  let flatTerm ← `(term| [$(flatSep),*])
  `(NN.Tensor.ofListOfLength (α := $elemTy) (dims := $dimsTerm) (xs := $flatTerm) (by tensor_len))

/--
Untyped variant of `tensor!`.

This is the common case: Lean infers the element type from the literal leaves (e.g. `Nat`, `Int`,
`Float`, `ℚ`, ...). If inference picks the wrong type, use the typed form
`tensor! (ty := α) ...` instead.
-/
macro "tensor!" xs:term:max : term => do
  let (dims, flat) ← TensorLit.parseNested xs
  let dimsElems : Array (TSyntax `term) :=
    dims.toArray.map (fun n => ⟨Syntax.mkNumLit (toString n)⟩)
  let flatElems : Array (TSyntax `term) :=
    flat.toArray.map (fun stx => ⟨stx⟩)
  let dimsSep := Syntax.TSepArray.ofElems (sep := ",") dimsElems
  let flatSep := Syntax.TSepArray.ofElems (sep := ",") flatElems
  let dimsTerm ← `(term| [$(dimsSep),*])
  let flatTerm ← `(term| [$(flatSep),*])
  `(NN.Tensor.ofListOfLength (dims := $dimsTerm) (xs := $flatTerm) (by tensor_len))

/-! ## Small index helpers -/

/-!
Writing `⟨0, by decide⟩` everywhere is noisy.

These macros are intended for examples/tests where the dimension is a literal or abbreviation, so
`by decide` can close the bounds proof. They are not a replacement for carrying a real
`Fin n` in library code.

Examples:
  `Tensor.vecGet v fin0!`
  `Tensor.vecGet v fin1!`
  `Tensor.vecGet v (fin! 5 3)`
-/

macro "fin0!" : term =>
  `(⟨0, by decide⟩)

/-- Convenience index `⟨1, by decide⟩` for example code where the bound proof is decidable. -/
macro "fin1!" : term =>
  `(⟨1, by decide⟩)

/-- Convenience index `⟨i, by decide⟩` packaged as `Fin n`, for examples/tests with literal bounds. -/
macro "fin!" n:term:max i:num : term =>
  `(show Fin $n from ⟨$i, by decide⟩)

/-!
`tensorF!` is a convenience macro for constants: build from **Float literals**, then cast into your
chosen runtime scalar backend using `cast : Float → α`.

Example:
  `let w : Tensor α (.dim 3 (.dim 2 .scalar)) := tensorF! cast [3, 2] [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5,
    0.6]`

This avoids noisy lists like `[cast 0.1, cast 0.2, ...]`.
-/
macro "tensorF!" cast:term:max dims:term:max xs:term:max : term =>
  `(Spec.mapTensor $cast
      (NN.Tensor.ofListOfLength (α := Float) (dims := $dims) (xs := $xs) (by tensor_len)))

/-!
`tensor32!` is the `tensor!` macro specialized to the executable IEEE-754 binary32 backend.

It builds a `Tensor Float _` from a nested bracket literal, then casts elementwise via
`IEEE32Exec.ofFloat`.

Example:
```lean
def w : Tensor TorchLean.Floats.IEEE32Exec (shape![2, 2]) :=
  tensor32! [[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4]]
```
-/
macro "tensor32!" xs:term:max : term =>
  `(Spec.mapTensor TorchLean.Floats.IEEE754.IEEE32Exec.ofFloat (tensor! $xs))

/-! ## Dynamic tensor wrapper (shape not in the type) -/

/-- A tensor paired with its shape, where the shape is stored as data instead of being in the type.

This is useful when:
- you need to accept arbitrary tensors at runtime (CLI / file formats / interoperability),
- but you still want to carry a `Shape` around so downstream code can inspect it.
-/
structure DynTensor (α : Type) where
  /-- Runtime shape tag carried alongside the tensor. -/
  s : Shape
  /-- Shape-indexed tensor whose type is tied to `s`. -/
  t : Spec.Tensor α s

/-- Build a `DynTensor` from runtime dims + flat data, with a runtime length check. -/
def dynamicOfList {α : Type} (dims : List Nat) (xs : List α) : Except String (DynTensor α) := do
  let t ← ofList (α := α) dims xs
  pure { s := shapeOfDims dims, t := t }

/-! ## Common dtype helpers (from Float literals) -/

/-- 1-D tensor from Float literals, cast into the executable IEEE-754 FP32 backend. -/
def float32Vector (xs : List Float) :
    Spec.Tensor (TorchLean.Floats.F32 .ieee754Exec) (.dim xs.length .scalar) :=
  Spec.mapTensor TorchLean.Floats.IEEE754.IEEE32Exec.ofFloat (vector (α := Float) xs)

/-- 2-D tensor from Float literals, cast into the executable IEEE-754 FP32 backend. -/
def float32Matrix (xss : List (List Float)) :
    Except String (Spec.Tensor (TorchLean.Floats.F32 .ieee754Exec)
      (.dim xss.length (.dim (if xss.isEmpty then 0 else xss.head!.length) .scalar))) := do
  let t ← matrix (α := Float) xss
  pure (Spec.mapTensor TorchLean.Floats.IEEE754.IEEE32Exec.ofFloat t)

/-! ## Printing -/

/-- A compact “dtype name” class used by `NN.Tensor.print`.

The class only records the display name needed by human-facing tensor output.
-/
class DTypeName (α : Type) where
  name : String

/-- Display name for `Float` tensors in `NN.Tensor.print`. -/

  name := "IEEE32Exec"
/-- Display name for proof-level real-valued tensors in `NN.Tensor.print`. -/
instance : DTypeName ℝ where
  name := "ℝ"

/-- Display name for TorchLean complex scalars in `NN.Tensor.print`. -/
instance {α : Type} [DTypeName α] : DTypeName (TorchLean.Complex α) where
  name := s!"Complex[{DTypeName.name (α := α)}]"

/-- A “pretty-printer with failure”.

We model printing as `Except String String` because some tensor element types are intentionally
non-printable (e.g. `ℝ` or proof-only floating-point models).
-/
class TensorPrintable (α : Type) where
  pretty : {s : Shape} → Spec.Tensor α s → Except String String

/-- Default printing for element types that support `ToString`. -/
