# Verification

Import this file for TorchLean’s verification infrastructure: JSON utilities, certificate formats,
ODE/PINN-style checkers, proof-backed certificate soundness, and the proof-backed TorchLean-to-IR
forward compiler bridge.

The compiler bridge is imported through `NN.Verification.TorchLean.Proved`, which contains both the
compiler and its correctness theorems.

Runnable CLIs stay out of this umbrella. If you want a command-line tool, import
the registry explicitly (for example `NN.Verification.CLI`).

The underlying CROWN/LiRPA soundness development enters here too. Executable examples can parse
JSON artifacts and recompute bounds inside Lean; theorem-level credit comes from those imported
soundness modules, where locally valid certificates are connected to Lean graph semantics.
