# Certificate Verification

Public umbrella import for TorchLean's executable certificate checkers.

These modules define:
- artifact parsers (JSON → typed structures),
- recomputation checkers that replay bound propagation inside Lean, and
- directional enclosure checks for interval claims and exact binary32 checks for replay
  transcripts.

Artifacts are treated as untrusted inputs: they only receive credit after passing these checkers.
