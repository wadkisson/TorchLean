# AbCrown Leaf Certificate

Alpha-beta-CROWN (AbCrown) leaf-certificate checker.

This module checks a small JSON certificate format (`abcrown_leaf_cert_v0_1`) exported by a Python
verification pipeline. It does **not** run bound propagation itself; instead it validates that:
- each leaf input box is nested inside the declared root input box, and
- each leaf contains a witness that refutes the unsafe threshold (`lb[i] > threshold[i]` for some
  `i`).

This is useful for:
- regression testing JSON export/import paths, and
- reviewer-friendly certificate validation workflows.

- alpha-beta-CROWN implementation: `https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/alpha-beta-CROWN`

Run:
`lake exe verify -- abcrown-leaf [path/to/cert.json]`

/-- Boolean `≤` on `Float` (used for array-wise box comparisons). -/
def leBool (x y : Float) : Bool := decide (x ≤ y)
/-- Boolean `<` on `Float` (used for strict refutation checks). -/
def ltBool (x y : Float) : Bool := decide (x < y)

/--
Check that a leaf box `[lo, hi]` is nested within a declared root box `[rootLo, rootHi]`.

All arrays are interpreted pointwise.
-/
def boxWithin (rootLo rootHi lo hi : Array Float) : Bool :=
  all2 rootLo lo leBool && all2 lo hi leBool && all2 hi rootHi leBool

/--
Check that a leaf is verified by a lower-bound vector `lb` against an unsafe threshold `thr`.

Interpretation: `lb` is a certified lower bound on some "violation score". If `lb[i] > thr[i]` for
some index `i`, then that unsafe constraint is refuted.
-/
def leafVerified (lb thr : Array Float) : Bool :=
  any2 lb thr (fun l t => ltBool t l)  -- ∃i, lb[i] > threshold[i]

/--
Like `leafVerified`, but first try a supplied witness index.

If the witness index is out of range, this returns `false` (callers usually fall back to
`leafVerified`).
-/
def leafVerifiedAt (lb thr : Array Float) (witnessIdx : Nat) : Bool :=
  if witnessIdx < lb.size ∧ witnessIdx < thr.size then
    ltBool thr[witnessIdx]! lb[witnessIdx]!
  else
    false

/--
Parse and validate a `abcrown_leaf_cert_v0_1` JSON certificate.

On failure this throws `IO.userError` with a brief message.
