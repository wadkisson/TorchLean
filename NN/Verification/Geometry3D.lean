# Geometry3D Verification

Reusable tensor-native checkers for 3D vision artifacts.

Real-model example producers live under `scripts/verification/geometry3d` and write untrusted JSON
artifacts under `_external/geometry3d`. This namespace contains the Lean checker, theorem
statements, and a small CLI wrapper around the checker.
