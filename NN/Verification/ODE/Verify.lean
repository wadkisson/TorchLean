# Verify

ODE enclosure verification via NN sub- and super-solutions.

This module implements the core executable checking loop inspired by arXiv:2601.19818:

Given candidate functions `u₋, u₊` with
  `u₋(t₀) ≤ u₀ ≤ u₊(t₀)`,
  `u₋(t) ≤ u₊(t)` for all `t`,
  `u₋'(t) ≤ f(t, u₋(t))` and `u₊'(t) ≥ f(t, u₊(t))` for all `t`,
these are the corridor inequalities used by the classical comparison theorem for enclosing a
solution of `u' = f(t,u)` inside `[u₋, u₊]`. The executable checker validates these sufficient
inequalities on the chosen time boxes; the mathematical existence/comparison theorem is the
external classical assumption behind the workflow.

Executable checking pipeline:
- import corridor networks (lower/upper) from PyTorch JSON weights,
- build a derivative graph `d/dt` by structural differentiation of the IR,
- use IBP bounds to bound `u(t)` and `u'(t)` on time boxes,
- evaluate the ODE RHS on those boxes (interval evaluation),
- recursively split the time domain until all boxes verify or we hit a depth/width limit.

- `inDim`: expected input dimension (1 for ODE time).
