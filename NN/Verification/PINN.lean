# PINN Verification

Reusable TorchLean support for physics-informed neural network verification.

The files under this namespace are library code: graph construction, PDE expression parsing,
residual-bound helpers, certificate checking, and dataset-backed interval containment checks.
Example directories should provide assets and Python producers only.
