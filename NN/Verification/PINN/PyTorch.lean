# PINN PyTorch

PyTorch import path for trained PINNs used by verification workflows.

This module exists so verification call sites can import one file:
`NN.Verification.PINN.PyTorch`.

Implementation is split for readability:

- `NN.Verification.PINN.PyTorch.Load` parses JSON into a shape-checked `PinnState`.
- `NN.Verification.PINN.PyTorch.ParamStore` turns a `PinnState` into the CROWN graph/parameter
  representation used by the verifier.
