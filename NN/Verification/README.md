# `NN/Verification`

This directory contains the reusable verification machinery for TorchLean. It is where examples and
CLI commands go when they need to turn a model, graph, certificate, dataset, or PDE residual into a
Lean-checkable object.

The runnable verification commands reuse the same pieces as the Bug Zoo, robustness examples,
PINN/scientific ML checks, ODE and spline certificates, and graph-level IBP/CROWN workflows.

## What Lives Here

- `TorchLean/`: compilation and semantic glue for connecting TorchLean model fragments to the
  verifier graph IR, plus proof-backed fragments for supported forward programs.
- `Cert/`: JSON certificate formats and executable recomputation checkers, including IBP, CROWN,
  alpha-CROWN, and alpha-beta-CROWN-style local node artifacts.
- `Robustness/`: dataset-backed robustness workflows, including certified accuracy for small
  sklearn digits models and VNN-COMP-style MNIST fully connected examples.
- `PINN/`: PDE expression parsing, graph builders, residual interval helpers, certificate replay,
  CLI commands, and dataset containment checks for PINN-style artifacts.
- `ODE/`: corridor certificate checking for learned subsolution and supersolution enclosures.
- `Geometry3D/`: camera/projection certificate checks for 3D bounding-box workflows.
- `LiRPA/`: small exported artifacts for attention, CNN, GRU, MLP, and transformer encoder
  certificates.
- `VNNComp/`: compact VNN-COMP-style network/property loaders and MNIST fully connected checks.
- `Util/`: shared parsing, tolerance, and numeric helpers.

## Main Workflows

TorchLean verification work has five recurring shapes.

1. A Lean-native model is lowered to `NN.IR.Graph`; interval or affine bounds are propagated over
   the graph; the checker reports whether the requested output relation follows from those bounds.

2. An external tool produces an artifact, such as an alpha-beta-CROWN-style certificate or exported
   JSON bounds. Lean parses the artifact and checks the predicate the format actually claims.

3. A scientific ML script exports small PDE or dataset artifacts. Lean reloads the residual
   expression, boxes, weights, samples, or intervals and checks the stated containment or residual
   condition.

4. A theorem-backed fragment connects the executable checker to a mathematical statement. This is
   where a checked artifact becomes part of a formal claim, with the Lean hypotheses and remaining
   producer assumptions visible at the call site.

5. A domain-specific checker takes a structured artifact and proves a smaller local claim: a 3D
   projection box contains the image of a cuboid, an ODE corridor encloses a trajectory, a PINN
   residual stays inside a stated interval, or a VNN-COMP-style classifier margin is nonnegative on
   an input box.

The common pattern is intentionally plain: parse a small artifact, check shape and schema fields,
recompute the claim in Lean, and name the assumptions that remain outside Lean.

## What Is Proved Versus Checked

External JSON is always treated as untrusted input. A checker may accept a file, but acceptance only
means the file satisfied the predicate implemented by that checker. Decimal tolerances are explicit
format tolerances. Soundness of the external producer is a separate claim and should be represented
by an exporter/provenance argument, a replayable certificate, or a theorem about the producer.

The theorem-level graph IBP/CROWN-family soundness results live under
`NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Proofs.*`. Public entry points expose those statements through
`NN.Verification.ProofBackedCertificates` and `NN.Entrypoint.Verification`.

The TorchLean-to-IR proof API is separate. It covers the compiler proof fragment and local
evaluator lemmas for supported imported operations. Current coverage includes elementwise
arithmetic and activations, reshape/flatten/broadcast/sum, concat, axis reductions, supported
transpose and permutation forms, rank-2/3 matrix multiplication, softmax through the evaluator's
axis-permutation path, payload-backed constants, `linear`, no-dilation `conv2d`, eval-mode NCHW
BatchNorm, CHW pooling, reshape-based LayerNorm, graph input/detach, and scalar MSE formulas used
by the PyTorch/ONNX path.

For payload-backed imported ops, the bridge records both the helper evaluator contract and the
actual one-step `Graph.evalAt` success path. `Eval.Coverage` keeps a checked list of the IR
constructor families covered by those local evaluator lemmas.

## Commands To Try

Run the curated verification suite:

```bash
lake exe verify -- all
```

Run TorchLean-native graph workflows:

```bash
lake exe verify -- torchlean-ibp
lake exe verify -- torchlean-crown-ops
lake exe verify -- torchlean-robustness
lake exe verify -- torchlean-mlp-workflow --dtype float
```

These commands compile or build small TorchLean models, attach input regions, and run native bound
passes over the graph-shaped object. Use them when changing graph lowering, bound propagation,
compiled execution, or the public verification facade.

Run a compact PINN certificate and residual-expression check:

```bash
lake exe verify -- pinn-cert
lake exe verify -- pinn-cli -- "u_t + u*u_x - 0.01*u_xx" 0.0 0.5 0.01
```

Run a dataset containment diagnostic for PINN artifacts:

```bash
lake exe verify -- pinn-dataset-check
```

Use `--strict` on diagnostic commands when misses should turn into command failure.

Run a compact alpha-beta-CROWN leaf certificate check:

```bash
lake exe verify -- abcrown-leaf
```

Run compact LiRPA-style fixture checks:

```bash
lake exe verify -- lirpa-mlp
lake exe verify -- lirpa-cnn
lake exe verify -- lirpa-attention
lake exe verify -- lirpa-gru
lake exe verify -- lirpa-encoder
```

These fixtures are small JSON artifacts for supported network fragments. They exercise the artifact
parser and replay predicate without depending on a live external verifier.

Run the small VNN-COMP-style MNIST fully connected workflow:

```bash
lake exe verify -- vnncomp-mnistfc
```

Run a 3D projection certificate check:

```bash
lake exe verify -- camera-box3d-cert
```

Run the spline certificate checker:

```bash
lake exe verify -- spline-cert
```

The exact command registry lives in `NN.Verification.CLI`; `lake exe verify --help` prints the
commands available in the current checkout.

## What A Checker Should Say

A new checker should answer five questions in the code or README:

1. What object is being checked?
2. What file format or runtime object is allowed to provide candidate data?
3. Which predicate is recomputed inside Lean?
4. Which theorem, if any, lifts the check to a mathematical statement?
5. Which producer, solver, runtime, or floating-point assumptions remain outside Lean?

That convention makes checker output precise: a successful run identifies the object, the predicate,
the theorem layer when one applies, and the remaining producer or runtime assumptions.
