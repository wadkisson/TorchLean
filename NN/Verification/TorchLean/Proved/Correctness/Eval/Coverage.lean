# IR Evaluation Coverage

This file is a proof-facing checklist for the local `Graph.evalAt` bridge lemmas.

The bridge lemmas themselves live in the operation-specific files.  Here we keep a small,
machine-checked summary of the IR operation tags currently covered by those local evaluator facts.
When a new `OpKind` constructor is added, this list should be updated together with the
corresponding `evalAt` theorem.

This is not a semantic equivalence theorem.  It is a maintained coverage guard: the list names the
IR constructor families that have local `Graph.evalAt` lemmas in this directory.

/--
Every current IR constructor family has an entry in the local evaluator bridge checklist.

The statement quantifies over `OpKind`, not only over the representative list above. If a new
constructor is added to the IR, this theorem stops compiling until the bridge coverage surface is
reviewed.

theorem evalAtCoverageTags_complete (kind : OpKind) :
    kind.tag ∈ evalAtCoverageTags := by
  cases kind <;> simp [evalAtCoverageTags, evalAtCoverageWitnesses, OpKind.tag]

/--
The checklist is exactly the set of current IR constructor tags.

Together with `evalAtCoverageTags_nodup`, this proves the coverage summary in both directions:
there is no missing constructor family and no stale tag unrelated to an `OpKind`.
