# PyTorch Translator Widget

This file implements the editor-side "write PyTorch, see TorchLean" translator workflow.

The goal is deliberately modest and honest:

- accept a Python source file, with a lower-level command for selected `nn.Sequential` /
  `nn.Module` text;
- recognize common layer constructors by name;
- emit a TorchLean skeleton using the public `nn.sequential!` style;
- report the exact boundary between translated layers, layers that need extra shape information,
  and Python code that is outside this supported-subset assistant.

This is **not** a verified Python parser and it is not a full PyTorch semantic import. For full
graph capture, the right path is still the existing `torch.export` JSON bridge in
`NN.Runtime.PyTorch.Import.TorchExport`. This widget is the fast, friendly "front door" that shows
whether a model is close to the supported TorchLean subset before users commit to the full
capture/import path.

The VS Code extension version can reuse this design:

1. Run a stronger Python-side analyzer (`ast`, `torch.fx`, or `torch.export`).
2. Send the normalized layer/graph report to Lean.
3. Display the same kind of TorchLean skeleton plus trust-boundary diagnostics.

For the in-repo workflow, prefer `#pytorch_translate_file "path/to/model.py"`. That command reads a
real Python source file and renders the report in the Lean infoview. The lower-level
`#pytorch_translate_view someString` command remains useful for tests and for future editor
integrations that already have selected text in memory.

/--
A layer shape recognized by the file-based PyTorch supported-subset analyzer.

The constructors intentionally describe *semantic layer families*, not exact Python AST nodes. For
example, `linear 784 128` can come from `nn.Linear(784, 128)` inside `nn.Sequential`, a field
assignment such as `self.fc = nn.Linear(784, 128)`, or a compact documentation snippet. The widget
uses this vocabulary to give immediate editor feedback while still marking anything outside the
supported subset as `unsupported`.

  /-- Fully connected layer with numeric `in_features` and `out_features`. -/
  | linear (inDim outDim : Nat)
  /--
  2D convolution with the fields this text-level assistant can reliably infer from common snippets.

  We do not generate executable TorchLean code directly from this constructor because a correct
  `nn.conv` term also needs the input contract: batch size, input height, and input width.
  -/

/--
Summary produced by the file-based supported-subset analyzer.

`layers` preserves the order in which relevant lines appear, including unsupported boundary items.
`translated` counts only recognized layer-family rows; `warnings` are global advice such as "this
CNN snippet needs an input image shape"; `unsupported` is a compact list for the red diagnostic
section in the widget.

  /-- Ordered layer/boundary rows extracted from the snippet. -/

/--
Small substring predicate used by the heuristic parser.

Lean's core string API is enough for this bounded-scope assistant. A VS Code extension should use
`ast`, `torch.fx`, or `torch.export` on the Python side rather than substring matching.
-/
private def hasSubstr (s needle : String) : Bool :=
  (s.splitOn needle).length > 1

/--
Normalize a source line before matching constructors.

Common PyTorch snippets write layers as assignments:

```python
self.fc1 = nn.Linear(784, 128)
```

The widget only needs the right-hand constructor, so this helper strips a simple assignment prefix
and trims whitespace. It deliberately does not try to understand arbitrary Python expressions.
-/
private def lineClean (s : String) : String :=
  let s := s.trimAscii.toString
  -- Drop the common `self.foo =` or `foo =` prefix so constructor matching is stable.
  match s.splitOn "=" with
  | _lhs :: rhs :: _ => rhs.trimAscii.toString
  | _ => s

/-- Convert an ASCII digit character to its numeric value. Called only after `Char.isDigit`. -/
private def digitVal (c : Char) : Nat :=
  c.toNat - '0'.toNat

/--
Extract decimal natural numbers from a constructor line.

This is enough for layer signatures like `Linear(784, 128)` and `Conv2d(3, 64, 7, stride=2,
padding=3)`. It intentionally ignores floating literals, symbolic dimensions, tuples with different
height/width values, and keyword names; those cases are better handled by the real graph-capture
path. The payoff is that the widget stays total, fast, and easy to inspect.

/--
Render a layer as a direct `nn.sequential!` term when that is safe for the supported subset.

Only vector-shaped elementwise and linear layers are emitted directly. Shape-changing CNN pieces are
not silently guessed, because that would create exactly the kind of misleading "it translated!"
experience TorchLean should avoid.

Render the non-direct pieces as comments in the generated skeleton.

These comments are part of the user-facing translator output. A user should be able to paste the skeleton into a
Lean file and immediately see which information is still missing: image shape, dropout probability
and seed, adaptive-pooling semantics, or an unsupported PyTorch operation.

/--
Analyze one source line.

The result has three possible meanings:

- `some layer`: a supported layer or explicit unsupported boundary was found;
- `none`: the line is ordinary Python structure (`class`, `def forward`, `return`, imports, etc.)
  or blank/comment text that should not become a report row;
- `some (.unsupported ...)`: the line looks like a PyTorch operation but is outside the supported
  translator subset.

This distinction keeps the report readable. We do not want to complain about every `class` or
`return`, but we do want to flag `nn.BatchNorm2d` or `torch.reshape` if the user expected a model
translation.

Analyze PyTorch source text using the small supported layer subset.

The analyzer is order-preserving and fail-soft: one unsupported line does not prevent later lines
from being recognized. That matters for editor UX, because users should still get a useful partial
skeleton even when one layer needs manual handling.

Generate a TorchLean skeleton from the recognized layer sequence.

The emitted code is meant to be a starting point, not a final theorem. It imports the public
TorchLean umbrella, opens the user-facing API namespaces, emits direct sequential terms for the safe
subset, and then appends boundary notes as Lean comments. The next intended step is to add a concrete
shape contract and wrap the model in a `train.Task` / `SeqTask`.

Low-level command frontend for already-selected source text.

This command accepts a Lean `String` term. It is mostly a hook for tests and future editor
integrations that already have selected Python text in memory. For normal in-repo use, prefer
`#pytorch_translate_file`, which reads a real `.py` file.

Usage:

```lean
def snippet : String :=
  "nn.Linear(784, 128)\n" ++
  "nn.ReLU()\n"
#pytorch_translate_view snippet
```

The argument is a Lean term of type `String`, so examples can define reusable snippets rather than
putting large multi-line strings directly in the command.

Read a Python source file and render the translator report.

This is the practical in-repo workflow:

The command runs during elaboration, reads the file relative to the current Lake working directory,
and displays the same report as `#pytorch_translate_view`. If the file is missing, the Lean build
does not crash with an opaque IO exception; the widget renders an explicit file-error panel instead.
