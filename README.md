  Formalizing Neural Networks in Lean
</h1>

TorchLean is a Lean 4 framework for writing, running, inspecting, and verifying
neural-network programs. It provides typed tensors and model APIs, a shared graph
IR, runtime/autograd support, finite-precision semantics, certificate checkers,
CUDA/runtime boundaries, and examples across modern ML and scientific ML.

The project is organized around one discipline: keep the object of the claim
visible. A classifier, FNO, PINN residual, optimizer step, imported checkpoint,
or verifier certificate should not become a loose collection of scripts once it
starts running. TorchLean gives those objects Lean names, executable paths, graph
representations, and theorem or checker APIs where the current library has
support.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git
cd TorchLean
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

For Linux, macOS, Windows/WSL, CUDA, optional LibTorch support, and an explanation of
TorchLean's backend architecture, see the [Installation guide](https://lean-dojo.github.io/TorchLean/installation/).

TorchLean is pinned by `lean-toolchain` and currently builds with
`leanprover/lean4:v4.32.0`.

## Quickstart

```bash
lake exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 10 --dtype float32 --backend eager
lake exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 10 --dtype float --backend eager

# Optional CUDA run, if the CUDA toolkit and an NVIDIA GPU are available:
lake -R -K cuda=true build
lake -R -K cuda=true exe torchlean mlp --device cuda --steps 1000
```

The first quickstart uses TorchLean's executable IEEE-style Float32 scalar. The
second uses Lean's builtin `Float` runtime path. The CUDA command uses the
native GPU runtime path and checks that the CUDA backend is available. Theorem
statements that mention CUDA cite the native-runtime boundary in
`TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md` instead of treating a kernel launch as Lean proof evidence.

The public code shape is:

```lean
import NN.API
open TorchLean

def model :=
  nn.Sequential![
    nn.Linear 2 8,
    nn.ReLU,
    nn.Linear 8 1
  ]

def xs : Tensor.T Float (shape![4, 2]) :=
  tensorOfList! [4, 2] [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0]

def ys : Tensor.T Float (shape![4, 1]) :=
  tensorOfList! [4, 1] [0.2, 1.0, 1.0, 1.8]

def data : Trainer.Dataset (.dim 2 .scalar) (.dim 1 .scalar) :=
  Data.tensorDataset xs ys

def trainOnce : IO Unit := do
  let trainer :=
    Trainer.new model
      { task := .regression
        optimizer := optim.sgd { lr := 0.05 }
        backend := .compiled
        dtype := .float32 }
  let initialPrediction ← trainer.predict (tensorOfList! [2] [0.5, -0.25])
  IO.println s!"initial={Tensor.pretty initialPrediction}"
  let trained ← trainer.train data { steps := 200, batchSize := 16, logEvery := 25 }
  trained.printSummary
```

## First Things To Try

```bash
lake exe torchlean --help
lake exe verify --help
lake exe verify -- torchlean-ibp
```

For the maintained examples:

```bash
lake build NN.Examples.Zoo
```

The public API is centered around `Trainer.new`. A trainer owns the model, task, optimizer, runtime
backend, scalar mode, and seed. It can run one prediction with `trainer.predict`, run training with
`trainer.train`, and return a trained handle whose `predict`, `predictBatch`, and `verify` methods
reuse the trained parameters. Verification commands use the same idea at the artifact level: the
CLI names the graph, certificate, dataset, or external producer boundary being checked.

The maintained command set currently includes quickstarts, supervised models, CNN/ViT, GPT-style
text, Mamba, diffusion, FNO Burgers, PPO/DQN, PyTorch round trips, data loaders, floating-point
deep dives, GraphSpec, BugZoo, and verification workflows such as `torchlean-ibp`,
`torchlean-crown-ops`, `abcrown-leaf`, `pinn-cert`, `pinn-dataset-check`, `digits-train-certify`,
and `vnncomp-mnistfc`.

## Use TorchLean From Another Lean Project

TorchLean is a normal Lake package. You can depend on the Git repository directly:

```lean
require TorchLean from git "https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean.git" @ "main"
```

Then run:

```bash
lake update
lake exe cache get
lake build
```

Use `import NN.API` for model, data, and training code. It provides the application-facing
`TorchLean.nn`, `TorchLean.classical`, `TorchLean.Data`, `TorchLean.Trainer`, and
`TorchLean.optim` namespaces. Use `import NN` when the same file also needs verification, proofs,
or backend infrastructure; focused imports such as `NN.GraphSpec`, `NN.Runtime`, or `NN.Proofs`
are available for subsystem work.

Downstream model and training files should start from:

```lean
import NN.API
open TorchLean
```

For local development against a checkout, use a path dependency instead:

```lean
require TorchLean from "../TorchLean"
```

  descriptions.

## Current Capabilities

The same rule applies across the tree: name the object, name the artifact, and name the boundary.

- **Training and runtime.** `Trainer.new` supports supervised tasks, scalar/backend choices,
  trained handles, prediction, logs, typed step streams, generated or file-backed batches, and
  optional CUDA-backed Float32 runtime paths. Public code should look like one trainer with selected
  backend options, not one public forward method per backend.
- **Graphs and compiler fragments.** TorchLean models can be lowered to a shared IR. A first-order
  forward fragment has Lean-side compiler-correctness theorems, and coverage grows operation by
  operation. GraphSpec describes typed architectures above the lower-level op-tagged DAG consumed by
  runtime, widgets, exporters, and verification passes.
- **Verification.** The repository includes IBP/CROWN-style graph checks, α/β-CROWN-style artifact
  replay, robustness workflows, VNN-COMP-style MNIST checks, PINN residual checks, ODE corridors,
  spline certificates, and 3D geometry projection certificates. External producers write compact
  artifacts; Lean parses the artifact, checks the stated predicate, and records any remaining
  producer assumptions.
- **ML theory.** The theory layer covers CROWN/LiRPA objects, optimizer laws, Muon
  orthogonalization certificates, learning-theory examples, generative objective identities,
  self-supervised-learning algebra, approximation theorems, and floating-point bridges. Optimizers
  use a generic `TensorOptimizer` interface so new update rules share finite-stream laws. A
  `StepSpec` is available when an independent mathematical recurrence must be related to the
  executable update.
- **Scientific ML.** The FNO Burgers and PINN/ODE paths show how numerical artifacts can be carried
  back into Lean checks. External simulators and optimizers remain named producers; Lean owns the
  artifact schemas, residual predicates, dataset checks, and certificate replay statements that sit
  at the verification boundary.

## Correctness and Boundaries

For correctness claims, trust assumptions, and third-party tooling:

- `TRUST_BOUNDARIES.md`
- `AI_USAGE.md`
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`

Lean proofs, executable checkers, Lake builds, tests, and explicit
trust-boundary documentation are the source of truth for what is proved,
checked, or assumed.
