The shortest useful TorchLean import is:

```
import NN.API

open TorchLean
```

It gives application code five main places to begin:

- `Tensor` for shape-indexed tensor values and constructors;
- `nn` for layers, blocks, model families, and seeded initialization;
- `Data` for in-memory datasets, loaders, checkpoints, and text helpers;
- `optim` for optimizer configurations;
- `Trainer` for prediction, training, summaries, and the public verification bridge.

We will take those names in order and use each one once. Every command below runs from the
repository root.

# First Contact: Print A Few Tensors

Run:

```
lake exe torchlean quickstart_tensors
```

The checked-in example prints:

```
== Quickstart: tensor basics ==
[Float] [0.100000, 0.200000, 0.300000, 0.400000]
[ℚ] [1/10, 1/5, 3/10, 2/5]
[Int] [1, 2, 3, 4]
[IEEE32Exec] [0.100000, 0.200000, 0.300000, 0.400000]
[Float] [[[1.000000, 2.000000], [3.000000, 4.000000]],
         [[5.000000, 6.000000], [7.000000, 8.000000]]]
Expected failure printing Tensor ℝ: Refusing to print `Tensor ℝ` ...
```

The same tensor structure can carry several scalar types. `Float` is Lean's executable host
floating type. `ℚ` is exact rational arithmetic. `IEEE32Exec` is TorchLean's executable bit-level
binary32 model. `ℝ` is useful in specifications and proofs, but arbitrary real values do not have a
general executable printer.

Open
[`NN/Examples/Quickstart/TensorBasics.lean`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Quickstart/TensorBasics.lean)
and find the definitions of `xF`, `xQ`, and `x32`. The values look alike when printed, but their
types select different arithmetic.

# Build A Small File Of Your Own

Create `Tour.lean` at the repository root:

```
import NN.API

open TorchLean

def point : Tensor.T Float (shape![2]) :=
  tensorOfList! [2] [0.25, -0.75]

def model : nn.M (nn.Sequential (.dim 2 .scalar) (.dim 1 .scalar)) :=
  nn.Sequential![
    nn.linear 2 8,
    nn.relu,
    nn.linear 8 1
  ]

def initialized :=
  nn.run 2026 model

#eval Tensor.pretty point
#eval IO.println (nn.info initialized)
```

Run it:

```
lake env lean Tour.lean
```

The expected output is:

```
"[0.250000, -0.750000]"
Sequential: [2] -> [1], layers=3, params=33
  [0] Linear(2, 8): [2] -> [8] params=24 [[8, 2], [8]]
  [1] ReLU: [8] -> [8] params=0 []
  [2] Linear(8, 1): [8] -> [1] params=9 [[1, 8], [1]]
```

The summary accounts for every scalar parameter:

$$`8\cdot2+8+1\cdot8+1=33`.

It also exposes the ordered payload shapes. A later compiler or checkpoint adapter must provide
weights and biases in this order and with these shapes.

As a quick experiment, change the hidden width from `8` to `12` in both linear layers. Before
running Lean, predict the parameter count:

$$`12\cdot2+12+1\cdot12+1=49`.

The model summary should confirm `params=49`.

# Tensor Constructors

TorchLean offers two useful styles for fixed data. `tensorOfList!` takes dimensions and a flat
row-major list:

```
def matrix : Tensor.T Float (shape![2, 3]) :=
  tensorOfList! [2, 3] [
    1.0, 2.0, 3.0,
    4.0, 5.0, 6.0
  ]
```

The nested `tensor!` syntax mirrors the visible dimensions:

```
def sameMatrix : Tensor.T Float (shape![2, 3]) :=
  tensor! [
    [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
  ]
```

Both constructors check their dimensions. `Tensor.vector` is convenient when the length should be
inferred from a list:

```
def inferred := Tensor.vector (α := Float) [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]

#check inferred
-- inferred : Tensor.T Float (shape![3])
```

Use an explicit type when the shape belongs to an interface. Use inference for local data whose
length is already clear from the value.

# Turn Rows Into A Dataset

A supervised dataset pairs one input tensor with one target tensor. Add to `Tour.lean`:

```
def xs : Tensor.T Float (shape![4, 2]) :=
  tensorOfList! [4, 2] [
    0.0, 0.0,
    0.0, 1.0,
    1.0, 0.0,
    1.0, 1.0
  ]

def ys : Tensor.T Float (shape![4, 1]) :=
  tensorOfList! [4, 1] [0.2, 1.0, 1.0, 1.8]

def dataset : Trainer.Dataset (.dim 2 .scalar) (.dim 1 .scalar) :=
  Data.tensorDataset xs ys

#check dataset
```

The outer dimension `4` counts examples. `Data.tensorDataset` removes that common batch axis from
the sample types, so each input has shape `[2]` and each target has shape `[1]`.

Try changing the declared type of `ys` to `shape![4]` while leaving `dataset` unchanged. Lean
rejects the dataset because its target samples would be scalars rather than length-one vectors. This
is the same distinction the model output type makes.

For large data, application code does not need to place every value in a source literal. `Data`
also exposes CSV, NPY, image, token-stream, batching, shuffling, and checkpoint helpers. The shape
conversion still occurs at a named boundary: runtime dimensions are checked before values enter a
statically shaped dataset.

# Configure A Trainer

Add:

```
def trainer : Trainer (.dim 2 .scalar) (.dim 1 .scalar) :=
  Trainer.new model
    { task := .regression
      optimizer := optim.adam { lr := 0.03 }
      seed := 2026 }

#check trainer
```

`Trainer.new` materializes the seeded builder and returns a handle carrying:

- the checked model;
- the loss task;
- optimizer and runtime settings;
- the initialization seed.

The default execution profile is checked CPU, using the eager runtime and host `Float`. A trainer
configuration may instead select the compiled runtime, executable IEEE binary32, or another backend
profile. Device and provider selection are runtime concerns; they do not change the model's input
and output shapes.

Training options belong to the call:

```
def options : Trainer.TrainOptions :=
  { steps := 200
    batchSize := 4
    logEvery := 25 }
```

In an `IO` definition, the public lifecycle is:

```
def trainTour : IO Unit := do
  let before ← trainer.predict point
  IO.println s!"before = {Tensor.pretty before}"

  let trained ← trainer.train dataset options
  trained.printSummary
  trained.printPrediction "after" point
```

`trainer.train` returns a trained handle. It does not mutate the immutable `trainer` definition in
the source file. The returned handle closes over the runtime state containing the updated
parameters.

# Hand The Model To The Trainer

At this point `Tour.lean` has a model, a dataset, and a trainer. The checked-in version of the same
workflow is ready to run:

```
lake exe torchlean quickstart_mlp \
  --device cpu \
  --steps 200 \
  --seed 2026
```

Its summary ends with:

```
dataset size = 25
mean_loss(before) = 0.761530
mean_loss(after) = 0.003234
heldout x=(0.25,-0.75), target=0.2, prediction(after)=[0.210239]
```

The next chapter opens this run up and follows one step through the model, loss, tape, optimizer,
and parameter update. Here the useful API fact is simpler: `Trainer.new` creates the initial handle,
and `train` returns a new handle containing the trained runtime state.

Command-specific help shows the available runtime options:

```
lake exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --help
```

At the top level,

```
lake exe torchlean --help
```

lists runnable model families and the common `--device`, `--dtype`, `--backend`, `--seed`, and
`--show-backend` flags.

# Take A Quick Look At Autograd

Training uses reverse-mode automatic differentiation. There is a small command for inspecting it
without the rest of the trainer:

```
lake exe torchlean quickstart_autograd
```

It prints gradients, VJPs, Jacobian rows and columns, and a Hessian-vector product. One particularly
useful pair compares a loss with the same loss after `detach`: the forward values agree, while the
detached gradient is zero. We will derive that behavior in the autograd walkthrough instead of
reproducing the full log here.

# Move From A Run To A Region

Executable verification tools use a separate runner:

```
lake exe verify -- list
```

For the small MLP workflow:

```
lake exe verify -- torchlean-ibp
```

This lowers a model to the graph IR, places an input box at its input node, and propagates intervals
to the output. The API has now moved below `Trainer`: the useful objects are `NN.IR.Graph`, the
parameter payload, the input region, and the IBP state. The graph and verification chapters develop
those objects carefully.

Application code that needs these lower layers should use focused imports:

```
import NN.IR
import NN.Verification
```

`import NN` is the broad umbrella for files that intentionally span models, proofs, floating-point
semantics, backend contracts, and verification. Ordinary training code should stay with `NN.API`;
the narrower import makes dependencies and generated documentation easier to understand.

# Looking Up Exact Names

The generated API page is the declaration index. In a Lean file, `#check` shows the elaborated type
of a name, while editor hover reveals its documentation and source. The guide stays focused on the
design and the worked programs; the API page answers exact-name questions without repeating the
module tree here.
