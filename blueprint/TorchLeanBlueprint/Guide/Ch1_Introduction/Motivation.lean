The verification problem in ML is not only that neural networks can fail. It is that the object we
check is often not exactly the object we ran.

A trained model may live as Python code, a checkpoint, an exported graph, a verifier input, and a
CUDA execution path. Each representation can be reasonable on its own, but a guarantee becomes
fragile if no one can say precisely how these representations agree. TorchLean is built around that
question: when a model is checked, what exact computation is the claim about?

# Why Neural Networks Are Awkward To Check

For ordinary software, a specification can often be crisp: a sorting routine returns a sorted list,
or a compiler preserves program meaning. Neural networks are less tidy. A useful claim usually
depends on a region of inputs, a trained parameter set, a numeric backend, and a property such as a
margin, an interval enclosure, a residual bound, a projection check, a Lyapunov condition, or a
robustness guarantee.

There is also a newer reason this matters. ML code is becoming easier to generate. A model, a
training loop, a verifier script, or an export wrapper can now be produced quickly by an LLM or
copied from a notebook. That is useful, but it changes the bottleneck. The scarce resource is no
longer only code. It is semantic accountability: knowing what the code means, what assumptions it
used, and whether the artifact being checked is the artifact that will be used.

This is especially important in scientific ML. A classifier error is already serious, but a learned
PDE surrogate, a neural controller, or a 3D perception certificate may sit inside a larger
scientific or engineering argument. In those cases, we do not only want to know that a model ran. We
want to know whether a residual was bounded, whether a controller satisfied the checked condition,
whether a projection certificate was replayed, or whether a finite precision execution stayed inside
the intended envelope.

Common failure modes include:

- *Adversarial vulnerability:* a small input change can flip a prediction while remaining inside the
  perturbation model a user considers harmless.
- *Distributional shift:* a model can fail when the deployment distribution differs from the
  training and validation distributions.
- *Shape and state mistakes:* broadcasting, normalization state, dropout mode, masks, tokenizers,
  and cache layouts can change the intended computation without crashing.
- *Serialization and interop mistakes:* a checkpoint can be loaded with parameter names, transposes,
  or layout conventions that differ from the graph a tool analyzed.
- *Floating-point mismatch:* rounding, fused kernels, fast math, and device differences can change
  the exact value being checked.

A concrete example is a prediction tensor of shape `[batch, 1]` compared with labels of shape
`[batch]`. A dynamic runtime may broadcast the two tensors and compute a loss over a larger shape
than intended. The training curve can still move. The bug is not a crash; it is a plausible-looking
experiment that optimized a different objective. A verification claim has the same risk if it talks
about the clean objective while the deployed computation used the broadcasted one.

# The Semantic Gap

The ML verification literature has made real progress: interval bound propagation, CROWN/LiRPA
relaxations, branch-and-bound methods, and mixed-integer encodings can prove useful robustness
properties for supported model classes.

The difficult part is connecting those checks to the artifact that actually ran. A proof about an
idealized real-valued network is useful, but it is not automatically a proof about a PyTorch module,
a CUDA kernel, a JSON checkpoint, or a float32 execution path.

That mismatch is the semantic gap. It can enter at many points:

- the architecture analyzed by a verifier may differ from the module used in training;
- the parameter payload may have been serialized under a different naming or layout convention;
- the theorem may quantify over real numbers while deployment uses float32 kernels;
- the graph checked by a certificate validator may omit preprocessing, masking, or mode-dependent
  state.

TorchLean is built around making those distinctions visible. The graph representation, the
floating-point semantics, and the verifier infrastructure are ordinary Lean artifacts. They are not
just labels attached to an experiment after it finishes.

# What Lean Statements Buy Us

A Lean statement is more than prose documentation. It fixes the objects under discussion, records
the quantifiers, and can be reused by later proofs without reinterpreting the claim. If a definition
changes in a way that invalidates the theorem, Lean asks us to repair the proof or weaken the
statement explicitly.

For a robustness claim, the useful shape is not merely "the model is robust." It is closer to:

$$`\forall x,\; x\in B
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\operatorname{margin}(\operatorname{denote}(g,\theta,x),y)>0`

Here the graph `g`, parameters `θ`, input region `B`, label `y`, scalar semantics, and denotation
are all part of the mathematical object being checked. A certificate checker can then prove that a
particular JSON artifact implies the bound predicate for that graph-payload pair.

For a compiler or runtime theorem, the useful shape is different:

$$`\forall x,\quad
\operatorname{denoteIR}(g,payload,x)
=
\operatorname{denoteCompiled}(\operatorname{compile}(g,payload),x)`

That statement does not claim the model is accurate. It claims that a transformation preserved the
meaning named by the IR semantics. This distinction matters: accuracy, robustness, compilation
correctness, and floating-point approximation are different properties, and TorchLean keeps them as
different theorems.

# Our Response

TorchLean keeps model code, graph semantics, executable float models, certificate checkers, and
proof statements in one Lean development. The project distinguishes checked Lean content from named
boundaries:

- the model is a Lean definition;
- the graph has a Lean denotation through the IR and specification layers;
- Float32 has explicit proof and executable models;
- CUDA and PyTorch sit behind documented boundaries;
- external certificates are parsed and checked according to stated predicates.

The recurring proof shape is:

$$`\text{checked artifact} \;+\; \text{named boundary assumptions}
\;\Longrightarrow\;
\text{semantic claim about the model}`

For a robustness verifier, that might mean that a checked certificate implies a positive margin on
all inputs in a box:

$$`\forall x\in B,\quad
\operatorname{margin}(\operatorname{denote}(model,\theta,x))>0`

For a runtime approximation theorem, it might mean that the executable float32 value remains inside
a proved interval around the real valued specification:

$$`\forall x,\quad
\operatorname{exec32}(model,\theta,x)\in
\operatorname{roundingEnvelope}(\operatorname{denote}_{\mathbb R}(model,\theta,x))`

The habit is the same in each case: the theorem should say what object was checked, what claim
follows, and which runtime or external assumptions remain. That is why TorchLean keeps runnable
code, graph artifacts, and formal statements close together rather than treating verification as a
report generated after the fact.
