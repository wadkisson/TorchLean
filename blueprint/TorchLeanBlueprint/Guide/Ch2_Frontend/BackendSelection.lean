The previous page selected CPU, CUDA, or an optional provider from the public API. Now we can look
at the less visible question: when a graph asks for matrix multiplication, attention, or a
reduction, how does TorchLean decide which implementation is allowed to answer?

A device name is not enough. One CUDA build may contain a hand-written kernel, a cuBLAS call, and a
LibTorch bridge for different operations. Their layouts, numerical behavior, backward support, and
supporting evidence differ. The backend planner keeps those differences in data and either returns
an accepted plan or explains why it could not make one.

The path is:

$$`
\text{operation}+\text{profile}+\text{available providers}
\longrightarrow \text{capsule}
\longrightarrow \text{audit}
\longrightarrow \text{accepted kernel}.
`

That path, rather than another tour of command-line flags, is the subject of this chapter.

# Kernel Capsules

Suppose a graph reaches scaled dot-product attention. TorchLean currently knows three maintained
ways to compute it: a composed TorchLean expression, a native fused CUDA implementation, and a
LibTorch forward bridge with a TorchLean-owned backward pass. The operation is the same; the
implementation contract is not.

A `KernelCapsule` records those differences:

```
structure KernelCapsule where
  name : String
  op : BackendOp
  provider : Provider
  device : Device
  trustLevel : TrustLevel
  supportsForward : Bool
  vjpMode : VJPMode
  shapeContract : ContractDescriptor
  layoutContract : ContractDescriptor
  valueContract : ContractDescriptor
  vjpContract : ContractDescriptor
  numericalPolicy : NumericalPolicy
  notes : String
```

Capsules are declared before the run and registered with the backend. The planner may select one
only when its device, provider, gradient mode, and assurance level fit the requested profile. If no
capsule fits, planning stops with an error.

Capsules are collected in named `CapsuleModule`s. Built-in attention, native CUDA, portable
reference, and optional LibTorch code contribute modules to the same registry. A downstream
provider can prepend another module with `BackendProfile.withCapsuleModules`; it does not add a new
model class or a branch to the graph walker. The model still lowers to ordinary `BackendOp`s, and
the planner either finds an admissible capsule for each operation or reports the missing operation.
Adding a module with an existing name replaces that module. Planning rejects repeated module names
and repeated capsule identities, so provider precedence cannot change through accidental duplicate
registration.

`BackendOp` names semantic operation families such as matrix multiplication, reduction, pooling, or
convolution. Rank, axes, padding, strides, and index tensors remain in the graph payload. This keeps
capability discovery general without erasing the information needed to state the operation
correctly.

```
#check NN.Backend.Registry.CapsuleModule
#check NN.Backend.BackendProfile.withCapsuleModules
```

The complete installation and platform guide includes a
[worked capsule example](https://lean-dojo.github.io/TorchLean/installation/#what-a-kernel-capsule-looks-like).

# Looking Inside A Capsule

Each capsule has four obligations: shape, layout, forward value, and VJP. An obligation may point to
a Lean theorem, an executable checker, a native source symbol, a fuzz oracle, or an explicit trusted
boundary.

The obligation itself is a structured `ContractClaim`: shape safety, compatibility with a named
tensor layout, refinement of a forward specification, or refinement of a VJP specification. The
free-form note is there for readers; the planner works with the structured claim.

Before planning, TorchLean checks that each descriptor has the right obligation kind and operation,
and that a VJP descriptor names the capsule's declared VJP mode. Thus a value theorem placed in the
shape field is rejected rather than counted as shape evidence. The registry author must still ensure
that the proposition carried by theorem or checker evidence is the intended formalization of the
structured claim; a capsule note is documentation, not a proof link.

The distinction matters:

- *theorem evidence* contains a Lean proposition and its proof term;
- *checker evidence* contains an accepted result and a soundness proof for its Lean proposition;
- *runtime-guard evidence* records validation performed at an execution boundary;
- *test evidence* records a regression or differential test suite;
- *fuzz evidence* records sampled differential testing, not a universal statement;
- *trusted external evidence* names code whose correctness is assumed for the claim;
- *missing evidence* prevents acceptance under the normal strict policies.

Numerical policy is recorded separately from evidence. It states which rounding mode, subnormal
behavior, multiply-add contraction, and reduction order the implementation uses. For example, the
portable matrix-product capsule records the fixed left fold used by the tensor semantics, whereas
the CUDA capsule records an implementation-dependent reduction. A range proof for one order cannot
therefore be reused for the other merely because both capsules implement `matmul`.

Source paths and native symbols identify the code behind a capsule. Strict acceptance asks for
proof-bearing theorem or checker evidence; ordinary maintained profiles may also allow named guards
and test coverage.

# A Real Attention Theorem

TorchLean's FlashAttention specification illustrates the proof boundary. The following are genuine
Lean declarations:

```
#check Spec.flashAttention_eq_scaledDotProductAttention
#check Spec.flashAttentionBackward_eq_scaledDotProductAttentionBackward
```

They prove that the fused *Lean specification* has the same forward and backward denotation as
TorchLean's standard scaled-dot-product-attention specification. They are useful for semantic graph
rewrites and for stating the contract expected of a fused implementation.

Those theorems compare two Lean specifications. The native CUDA capsule additionally records the
runtime guards, regression tests, source provenance, and `checked` trust level used for the actual
kernel. Connecting PTX or a library call all the way to the specification would require another
refinement argument over Float32, layout, compiler, and hardware behavior.

# Forward And Backward Ownership

Inference asks for a forward value. Training asks for more: the value must remain connected to the
derivative rule used by the optimizer.

TorchLean distinguishes three VJP modes:

- `none`: no gradient is requested;
- `torchLeanTape`: TorchLean records the node and applies its local backward rule;
- `backendVJP`: TorchLean owns the tape, while a named backend kernel computes the local VJP.

The preferred external-forward design is therefore precise: a provider may compute a fast forward
value, TorchLean records the same operation on its tape, and TorchLean applies the backward rule.
This requires enough forward information to be retained for that rule. If the bridge cannot provide
it, the implementation must fall back or expose a larger trust boundary.

The maintained LibTorch-forward profile implements this design for scaled-dot-product attention.
It prefers the registered LibTorch forward capsule and selects native CUDA capsules for surrounding
operations. Provider selection is therefore per operation, not a second model API or an
attention-specific boolean switch.

No-grad sessions request `none` automatically. During training, a differentiable operation cannot
select a forward-only capsule. Seeded random sources are the deliberate exception: they create
non-differentiable values, so they do not need a local VJP of their own.

# Boolean Attention Masks

TorchLean gives boolean attention masks one semantics across specifications and runtimes. A blocked
entry contributes exactly zero to the softmax numerator, as if its score were negative infinity.
Native CUDA skips blocked entries, while the LibTorch bridge passes a boolean mask directly to
scaled dot-product attention. Additive score biases remain a separate operation.

# Acceptance Gates

Planning and acceptance are separate steps. Planning finds capsules for graph operations. Auditing
turns their contract fields into obligation reports. An `AssurancePolicy` then decides whether the
run may proceed.

The implementation follows one explicit path:

1. `Target` describes the operating system, architecture, accelerator, and compiled features.
2. `Availability` states the devices and providers declared for planning. Eager execution performs
   the separate linked-library and hardware probes before launching a kernel.
3. `Registry` supplies compatible capsules, and `Planner` chooses one `PlannedKernel` for each graph
   operation. Together these choices form an `ExecutionPlan`.
4. `Audit` and `Recheck` expose the selected evidence and any obligations that must be discharged
   again for this run.
5. `Gate` applies the requested assurance policy. Eager execution receives an `AcceptedKernel` for
   each operation. Graph lowering can similarly produce an `AcceptedGraphPlan` for a later graph
   executor; the current eager runtime does not pretend that this data-level graph plan is executable.
6. `Report` renders the providers, devices, trust levels, and recheck dispositions for logs and
   benchmark records.

These are Lean data structures rather than an informal convention between command-line flags. The
eager runtime consumes the accepted per-operation value and records the capsule it actually used.
Inspection tools can retain rejected graph plans and explain why they failed.

`AcceptedKernel` and `AcceptedGraphPlan` carry the equality proof that their policy gate returned
`accepted`; they are not records that a caller can populate while omitting the gate result.

The strict policy allows proof-bearing theorem and checker evidence. Runtime policies can also
permit guards, regression tests, fuzzing, or a named external dependency. The gate itself has a
small Lean theorem:

```
#check ExecutionAudit.gate_eq_accepted_iff_gateFailures_eq_nil
```

This theorem says exactly what the policy function does: it accepts precisely when the audit has no
failures. The evidence inside that audit is what carries the kernel-specific argument.

# Public Configuration

The model API stays independent of these implementation details:

```
def trainerFor (backend : TorchLean.Runtime.Backend) :=
  Trainer.new mkModel
    { task := .regression
      optimizer := optim.adam { lr := 0.01 }
      dtype := .float32
      backend := backend }

let eagerTrainer := trainerFor .eager
let compiledTrainer := trainerFor .compiled
```

Device and provider selection live in runtime configuration and command-line options. Backend
selection does not change the model's public forward function. This is similar to the separation
between calling a PyTorch model and wrapping it with `torch.compile`: compilation changes
execution, not the mathematical intention of the model.

# Reading The Report

These statements have different strengths:

- "the example ran on CUDA" reports an execution path;
- "CUDA matched the CPU reference on this test suite" reports finite parity evidence;
- "the fused attention spec equals standard attention" cites a Lean semantic theorem;
- "the native attention kernel implements the fused spec" requires a native refinement argument;
- "the LibTorch result is correct" depends on the explicitly named LibTorch boundary unless a
  stronger checker or theorem covers it.

A backend report records the selected provider and the evidence attached to it. Keeping that report
beside a benchmark makes “CUDA” concrete: readers can see which operations were native, external,
checked, or proved.
