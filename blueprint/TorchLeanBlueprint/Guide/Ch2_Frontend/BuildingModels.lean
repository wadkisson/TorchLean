A TorchLean model begins as a map between tensor shapes. Initialization, loss functions, optimizer
state, and execution devices are attached later. This separation is useful even before proving a
theorem: the architecture can be inspected without allocating parameters, and the same model can
be initialized twice with different seeds or interpreted by different runtimes.

We will build three examples:

1. a `2 → 8 → 1` regression MLP;
2. a small convolutional classifier;
3. a transformer encoder block.

They use the same layer-composition mechanism. The differences are in their shapes and operations,
not in a new model universe for each application.

# A Layer Is A Checked Shape Map

The public layer type is:

```
nn.LayerDef inputShape outputShape
```

A sequential model has:

```
nn.Sequential inputShape outputShape
```

The input and output shapes are indices of the type, so composition requires equality at the
boundary. If:

$$`f:s_0\to s_1`

and

$$`g:s_1\to s_2`,

then `g` may follow `f`. A layer expecting `s_3` cannot be inserted there merely because the two
shapes contain the same number of values.

Model builders use:

```
nn.M A
```

which is a seeded construction of `A`. It allocates deterministic seeds for parameterized layers
but does not run a forward pass or optimizer update.

# The Running MLP

Here is the model used throughout the introduction:

```
import NN.API
open TorchLean

def inDim : Nat := 2
def hidden : Nat := 8
def outDim : Nat := 1

def model :
    nn.M (nn.Sequential (shape![inDim]) (shape![outDim])) :=
  nn.Sequential![
    nn.linear inDim hidden,
    nn.relu,
    nn.linear hidden outDim
  ]
```

Read the macro from top to bottom:

```
input [2]
  -> linear 2 8
hidden [8]
  -> relu
hidden [8]
  -> linear 8 1
output [1]
```

`ReLU` is shape-preserving. The two linear layers each change the final feature axis. The macro
checks that the chain is composable and returns one `Sequential [2] [1]`.

The parameter layout follows PyTorch's linear-layer convention:

$$`
W:\operatorname{Tensor}\;\alpha\;[\mathrm{out},\mathrm{in}],
\qquad
b:\operatorname{Tensor}\;\alpha\;[\mathrm{out}].
`

For this MLP the parameter shapes, in order, are:

```
[8, 2]   first weight
[8]      first bias
[1, 8]   second weight
[1]      second bias
```

The total parameter count is:

$$`8\cdot2+8+1\cdot8+1=33`.

Parameter order is part of the typed model interface. A pack with the two bias tensors exchanged
does not match the expected dependent list.

# Make A Shape Error On Purpose

Change the final layer to:

```
nn.linear 7 1
```

The preceding ReLU produces shape `[8]`, while this layer accepts `[7]`. Lean rejects the model at
definition time. No data or parameters need to be loaded to expose the mismatch.

A subtler experiment is:

```
nn.Sequential![
  nn.linear 2 8,
  nn.linear 8 8,
  nn.relu,
  nn.linear 8 1
]
```

This version compiles because the shapes compose. It is a different architecture with another
weight matrix and bias. Shape safety prevents malformed composition; it does not declare two
well-shaped networks equivalent.

# Initialization Is Reproducible State

The model declaration describes how parameters should be created. The trainer supplies the seed:

```
def trainer (seed : Nat) :=
  Trainer.new model
    { task := .regression
      optimizer := optim.adam { lr := 0.03 }
      seed := seed }
```

Constructing this value does not yet train. It records:

- the model builder;
- the task and loss convention;
- the optimizer configuration;
- the initialization seed;
- runtime options such as scalar type, backend, and device.

Using the same seed and configuration should produce the same initial TorchLean parameter values.
Changing only the seed is therefore a controlled experiment rather than an accidental mutation of
a global generator.

# Inspect The Architecture Before Training

The running-example chapter trained this MLP. Here we are interested in the object that existed
*before* the trainer was created:

```
def initialized := nn.run 2026 model

#eval IO.println (nn.info initialized)
```

The summary is:

```
Sequential: [2] -> [1], layers=3, params=33
  [0] Linear(2, 8): [2] -> [8] params=24 [[8, 2], [8]]
  [1] ReLU: [8] -> [8] params=0 []
  [2] Linear(8, 1): [8] -> [1] params=9 [[1, 8], [1]]
```

This is a useful design loop. Change `hidden` to `2`, `16`, and `64`; predict the parameter count
before asking Lean. Then insert another hidden `linear` and `relu` pair. The public input and output
stay `[2] → [1]`, while the internal shape chain and parameter payload grow.

# Prefix Shapes Give Batches For Free

Linear layers act on the final dimension and preserve the prefix. The model can therefore be lifted
to a fixed batch:

```
def batchedModel {batch : Nat} :
    nn.M
      (nn.Sequential
        (shape![batch, 2])
        (shape![batch, 1])) :=
  nn.Sequential![
    nn.linear 2 8,
    nn.relu,
    nn.linear 8 1
  ]
```

Nothing in `nn.linear` calls the prefix “batch.” It could equally be `[time]`, `[batch,time]`, or a
higher-rank collection. The operation's contract is simply:

$$`
[\ldots,\mathrm{inFeatures}]
\longrightarrow
[\ldots,\mathrm{outFeatures}].
`

This is the same broad behavior users expect from PyTorch, with the full map recorded in the Lean
type. `Data.batchDataset` later collates per-sample tensors into a model whose prefix begins with
the chosen batch size.

# A Rank-Generic Convolutional Model

TorchLean does not need separate tensor types for signals, images, and volumes. A convolution is
parameterized by a vector of spatial sizes. The length of that vector determines the spatial rank.

For a two-dimensional input, the conventional shape is:

$$`
[\mathrm{batch},\mathrm{channels},\mathrm{height},\mathrm{width}].
`

For one-dimensional signals it is:

$$`
[\mathrm{batch},\mathrm{channels},\mathrm{length}].
`

The public `nn.conv` constructor handles both. Pooling is rank-generic for the same reason. A helper
such as `nn.models.cnn` composes convolution, activation, pooling, flattening, and classification,
but the component layers remain ordinary checked maps.

Run the small convolutional example:

```
lake exe torchlean quickstart_cnn \
  --device cpu --batch 2 --steps 3 --seed 2026
```

The current run gives:

```
dataset size = 3
mean_loss(before) = 0.689656
mean_loss(after) = 0.683643
steps=3 loss0=0.689656 loss1=0.683643
vertical-1 expected=0 =
  [[0.160828, -0.082255], [0.160828, -0.082255]]
```

The leading dimension in the final output is two because we requested batch size two. The two rows
are not created by a special image container; they are the preserved tensor prefix.

The relevant source files are:

- [`SimpleCnnTrain.lean`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Quickstart/SimpleCnnTrain.lean);
- [`Cnn.lean`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/API/Models/Cnn.lean);
- [`ResNet.lean`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/API/Models/ResNet.lean).

Residual blocks require their main and skip paths to return the same shape before addition. A
projection shortcut is therefore an explicit layer, not a runtime broadcasting guess.

# A Transformer Encoder

A transformer encoder normally consumes:

$$`
[\mathrm{batch},\mathrm{sequenceLength},d_{\mathrm{model}}].
`

The public block constructor is:

```
nn.transformerEncoderBlock
  (batch := batch)
  (n := sequenceLength)
  (dModel := dModel)
  { numHeads := 2
    headDim := dModel / 2
    ffnHidden := 4 * dModel }
```

Its architecture contains:

1. multi-head self-attention;
2. a residual connection and layer normalization;
3. a position-wise feed-forward network;
4. another residual connection and normalization.

The head configuration must agree with `dModel`; dimensions that must be nonzero appear as Lean
obligations. Boolean masks are explicit and use hard-mask semantics: blocked positions have zero
softmax numerator. TorchLean does not silently replace that mathematical operation with a finite
additive constant such as `-1000`.

Run one optimizer step:

```
lake exe torchlean transformer \
  --device cpu --steps 1 --log false
```

The current example reports:

```
[TorchLean] dtype: Float (Lean `Float`, trusted runtime semantics)
[TorchLean] backend: Runtime.Autograd.Torch.Backend.eager
[TorchLean] device: cpu
dataset size = 1
mean_loss(before) = 2.499999
mean_loss(after) = 2.498999
torchlean transformer: ok
```

The log identifies the scalar type, execution mode, and device chosen for this run. The next runtime
chapters explain how those choices are made.

# Model Families Are Constructors, Not New Frameworks

KANs, GPT-style language models, vision transformers, recurrent models, neural operators,
autoencoders, diffusion models, and reinforcement-learning policies all build from the same shape,
parameter, and runtime interfaces.

For example, `nn.models.KANConfig` records input/output dimensions, hidden widths, and an edge basis
family. The basis is explicit because a KAN edge performs a learned scalar function rather than an
ordinary affine weight. It still returns a seeded model builder that can be trained through the
same trainer boundary.

A Fourier neural operator uses spectral transforms and mode truncation, but its input and output
remain general tensors. The Burgers example later in the guide shows how a PDE trajectory dataset,
FNO model, exported prediction, and Lean-checkable residual artifact fit together.

The practical rule is: a model helper should remove repetitive construction, not invent a private
tensor type or execution engine.

# The Task Belongs To The Trainer

Architecture determines the output tensor, not what that tensor means. A `[classes]` output can be
used as logits for cross entropy, scores for a margin loss, or values passed to a custom objective.

TorchLean therefore writes:

```
Trainer.new model { task := .regression }
Trainer.new model { task := .classification }
Trainer.new model { task := .crossEntropy }
Trainer.new model { task := .custom lossProgram }
```

Regression uses mean-squared error by default. Classification variants specify their target
convention. A custom task supplies a checked scalar loss program. This makes the loss visible in
the training configuration rather than baking it into the model architecture.

# What We Carry Forward

Every model family above produces the same kind of object: a checked map between shapes with an
ordered parameter layout and a forward program. The next chapters add data, a loss, and mutable
training state to that object. Graph lowering later reads the same shapes and payload order.
