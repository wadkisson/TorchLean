The runtime layer is where a typed model becomes a run. It allocates values, records operations,
computes gradients, updates parameters, writes logs, and produces artifacts that can be inspected
later.

The main thing to remember is that TorchLean has more than one runtime artifact. Eager execution
produces a tape. Compiled execution produces a reusable graph-shaped object. Verification uses an
operation-tagged IR. These artifacts are related, but they are not the same data structure.

If a compact model has not run all the way through yet, *Training From Scratch* is the best first
stop; it makes the runtime layer much easier to ground.

# PyTorch Mental Model

PyTorch's default workflow is approximately:

1. create parameters and modules,
2. run a forward pass,
3. let autograd record the operations used by that forward pass,
4. call `loss.backward()` to compute gradients,
5. call `optimizer.step()` to update parameters,
6. zero gradients and repeat.

TorchLean keeps the rhythm but changes where the objects live:

- parameters and modules become explicit typed values and parameter bundles;
- the dynamic autograd tape becomes a Lean `Tape`;
- `.grad` accumulation becomes explicit gradient values returned by reverse mode;
- the normal user-facing loop is `trainer.train`; manual `optimizer.step()`-style loops live behind
  `Trainer.Advanced.step`/`stepper` for runtime work;
- eager mode produces a tape, while compiled mode produces a reusable graph-shaped artifact.

That mapping is useful because it lets a PyTorch reader recognize the workflow without treating the
runtime state as hidden global context.

# Runtime Artifacts

It is useful to separate artifacts by what they are for.

An eager tape is for debugging and reverse mode. It records runtime values, parent links, and local
VJP closures. It is the closest TorchLean analogue of PyTorch eager autograd.

A compiled graph is for repeated execution. It fixes the graph-shaped structure once and reuses it
across many calls. This is the "compile once, run many times" path for supported programs.

An `NN.IR.Graph` is for inspection and verification. Its nodes carry operation tags, shapes, and
parent ids. A verifier can read this object without executing arbitrary closures.

A runtime context is for named values and training state. It records parameters, gradients, RNG
state, backend selection, and values useful for debugging.

A training log is for audit and debugging. It records losses, metrics, and reports produced during
the run. It is not the model semantics, but it is the artifact that tells us what happened.

# Two Execution Modes

TorchLean exposes one front end with two execution backends:

- *Eager*: tape recording and reverse-mode backprop in the style familiar from PyTorch.
- *Compiled*: a stable SSA/DAG-like artifact for repeated evaluation and proof alignment.

Many curated examples accept `--backend eager|compiled`.

```
lake env lean --run NN/Examples/Quickstart/SimpleMlpTrain.lean -- --steps 50 --dtype float --backend eager
lake env lean --run NN/Examples/Quickstart/SimpleMlpTrain.lean -- --steps 50 --dtype float --backend compiled
```

With matching seeds and supported operators, the forward computation should agree. What changes is
the artifact:

- eager is easier to step through;
- compiled is easier to replay and connect to graph-shaped proof artifacts.

# Runtime Contexts And Named Values

Spec tensors are indexed by shape, but realistic training loops need registries:

- parameter maps such as `"w1" ↦ weights`;
- gradient maps such as `"w1" ↦ dL/dw1`;
- named values for debugging and widgets.

TorchLean therefore uses an existential container, `Runtime.AnyTensor α`, which pairs a `Shape` with
the corresponding tensor. That preserves the strongly typed spec layer while still supporting
runtime-style tooling.

See the [runtime context API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Context.lean)
and the runtime-context widgets for the concrete declarations.

# A Small Runtime Walkthrough

For a single training step, the objects move like this:

1. Build a model and parameter bundle through `NN.API`.
2. Run a forward pass with a chosen backend.
3. Produce a scalar loss.
4. Run reverse mode to obtain explicit gradients.
5. Pass parameters and gradients to an optimizer update.
6. Log metrics and, when needed, inspect the tape or compiled graph.

Those steps change the runtime state and the produced artifacts. They do not require rewriting the
architecture or the parameter-shape contract.

# Autograd Tape

The eager engine records operations into a `Tape`:

- nodes store forward values;
- nodes remember parent ids;
- nodes carry local VJP closures;
- reverse mode traverses node ids backward and accumulates gradients.

In PyTorch terms, this is the part of the system behind `loss.backward()`. TorchLean makes the tape
and gradient flow explicit. There is no hidden `.grad` mutation on tensor objects; the reverse pass
produces gradients directly.

The widgets make this visible:

- `#tape_view t` renders nodes, parents, and values;
- `#tape_grads_view t, outId` runs scalar backprop and shows which nodes receive gradients;
- `#tape_trace_view t, outId` shows the reverse traversal step by step;
- `#runtime_ctx_view ctx` shows the value and gradient registries.

The [widgets example](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Advanced/Widgets.lean)
contains compact examples for these views.

# Compiled Graphs

The compiled runtime uses a typed SSA/DAG representation. Each node bundles the information needed
for forward evaluation and derivative propagation:

- `forward` computes a value;
- `jvp` computes a forward-mode pushforward;
- `vjp` computes a reverse-mode pullback.

The reason to keep this compiled form separate from the eager tape is practical. Eager mode is best
for debugging and notebook-style iteration. Compiled mode is best for a stable, replayable artifact
that proof code can reason about. Both paths can be produced from the public model definition.

# IR Execution Bridge

For verification, TorchLean standardizes on `NN.IR.Graph`, the operation-tagged DAG described in
*Graphs and IR*. Runtime closures are good for execution, but a verifier needs explicit operation
tags, shapes, and parent ids.

The [IR execution compiler](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Compiled/IRExec.lean)
connects the operation-tagged IR to the compiled runtime backend. In words, `execGraphOfIR` produces
a compiled graph whose forward evaluation agrees with the IR evaluator on the same payload and
input, for the supported operator fragment.

# Proof Link

The proof layer follows a local-to-global pattern. Each primitive operation has a forward rule and a
VJP rule. If the local VJP rule is the adjoint derivative of the local forward rule, then reverse
traversal of a well-formed graph computes the adjoint derivative of the whole graph.

Later proof chapters state the exact Lean theorems. Here the runtime fact to remember is simpler:
the tape and compiled artifacts expose the structure those theorems need.

# CUDA Is A Backend Choice

CUDA details have their own guide page. The runtime-level mental model is short: GPU mode accelerates
supported Float32 buffer operations, while Lean still owns the model structure, typed interfaces,
logs, graph artifacts, and proof/checker statements.

Use eager mode for stepping through compact examples. Use compiled mode for repeated evaluation over a
stable graph-shaped artifact. Use CUDA when the supported Float32 runtime should place numeric work
on device buffers.

To read the runtime layer in dependency order, begin with eager tensors and tapes, then compiled
graph construction, then the IR execution bridge, and finally the curated model examples.
