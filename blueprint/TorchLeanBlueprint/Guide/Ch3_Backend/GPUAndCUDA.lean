CUDA belongs in TorchLean for a practical reason: serious ML systems use GPUs. If TorchLean only
worked for small CPU examples, it would miss many places where semantic mistakes actually happen:
fused attention, reductions, cuBLAS GEMM, cuFFT, selective scans, spectral convolution, and
device-side randomness.

The design is therefore pragmatic. CUDA accelerates supported Float32 runtime paths. The Lean-side
spec and graph semantics remain the reference objects. Claims about native execution go through
runtime agreement statements, parity tests, sanitizer checks, or future kernel-level proofs.

# Backend Choices

The CUDA design follows a few choices that are easy to miss if one only looks at the command line
flags.

1. *CUDA is opt-in at build time.* A normal `lake build` should work on machines without a GPU or a
   CUDA toolkit. Building with `-K cuda=true` is an explicit decision to link native device code.
2. *CUDA is a runtime backend, not a second semantics.* The Lean model, the spec layer, and the
   verifier IR keep their meaning. CUDA changes where supported float32 tensor work runs.
3. *The backend is intentionally narrow.* The first target is float32 tensor work used by the model
   zoo: matmul, convolution, reductions, attention helpers, FFT/FNO kernels, and related VJP rules.
4. *Runtime agreement is stated explicitly.* TorchLean documents which facts are proved in Lean,
   which behaviors are specified in Lean, and which native behaviors are validated by tests.

A precise CUDA claim has three parts: the Lean-side specification, the native implementation path,
and the agreement evidence between them.

# The Short Version

Use CUDA when you want to train or evaluate larger float32 models from Lean:

```
lake build -R -K cuda=true
lake exe -K cuda=true torchlean mlp --cuda --steps 20
lake exe -K cuda=true torchlean fno1d_burgers --cuda --fast-kernels --steps 700 --lr 0.003
```

Then run the CUDA test suite:

```
lake exe -K cuda=true nn_tests_suite
```

To test the native CUDA boundary, run the same Lean-driven suite under NVIDIA's sanitizer:

```
scripts/checks/cuda_sanitize_tests.sh
scripts/checks/cuda_sanitize_tests.sh --all-tools
```

The flag `-K cuda=true` is a *build* flag. It selects the native CUDA objects in the
[CUDA source tree](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/csrc/cuda/) and links CUDA libraries such as cuBLAS and cuFFT. The
command line flag `--cuda` is a *runtime* flag. For long training runs, model commands also expose:

```
--cuda-mem-watch N
```

That flag samples the CUDA allocator every `N` optimizer updates. It reports live and peak runtime
allocation state and warns if the observed free-memory trend would exhaust the device before the
requested run length. When a long CUDA run does not pass an explicit cadence, the public model
examples choose a small default number of samples. This is part of the public runner interface, not
a one-off benchmark script, so MLP, CNN, GPT-style, ResNet, ViT, and other model commands can report
the same kind of long-run memory signal.

If either piece is missing, TorchLean should fail loudly rather than silently claiming that GPU
execution happened.

# What Lives In The CUDA Backend

The native backend is deliberately small enough to audit:

- [`tensor/`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/csrc/cuda/tensor/)
  owns raw float32 buffers and elementwise tensor kernels;
- [`blas/`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/csrc/cuda/blas/)
  provides cuBLAS-backed matrix multiplication;
- [`conv_pool/`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/csrc/cuda/conv_pool/)
  provides convolution and pooling kernels;
- [`kernels/`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/csrc/cuda/kernels/)
  contains reductions, broadcasting, gathers/scatters, attention helpers, selective scan, FFT, and
  fused spectral convolution kernels;
- [`common/`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/csrc/cuda/common/)
  contains shared shape, RNG, error-checking, and deterministic-reduction helpers.

On non-CUDA builds, corresponding stub files are compiled instead.  Those stubs are not fake
success paths; they are CPU reference implementations used by tests and by machines without a CUDA
toolkit.

# Implemented CUDA Surface

The CUDA work in TorchLean is more than a single "move tensors to GPU" hook.  It is a layered
runtime path for float32 autograd, with the fast pieces placed behind explicit FFI symbols and the
specification pieces kept in Lean.

The main implemented pieces are:

- *opaque CUDA buffers and a CUDA eager tape*: Lean records the shapes, tape nodes, parent links,
  and VJP wiring; native code owns allocation, device memory, kernel launches, and buffer
  reads/writes;
- *host/device conversion*: Lean `Float` values are uploaded through the float32 contract, device
  results are downloaded through raw binary32 bits, and tests compare both CUDA and stub paths;
- *elementwise tensor kernels*: add, multiply, divide, square root, exp/log-style helpers,
  broadcasting, masks, gathers, scatters, concatenation, slices, and related VJP rules;
- *reductions*: fast reductions for training and deterministic reduction contracts for paths where
  bitwise replay matters;
- *cuBLAS-backed GEMM/BMM*: matrix multiplication and batched matrix multiplication use vendor BLAS,
  while Lean records the row-major shape and indexing contract around the column-major cuBLAS API;
- *convolution and pooling*: 2D and rank-generic convolution, transposed convolution, max pooling,
  average pooling, smooth max pooling, and their backward paths;
- *deterministic RNG kernels*: uniform and Bernoulli/dropout-style masks use the same SplitMix64
  stream convention as the CPU path, keyed by explicit seeds and linear indices;
- *FlashAttention style fused attention*: the runtime can call a fused native attention forward and
  fused VJP instead of materializing scores, mask application, softmax, and value multiplication,
  while the Lean spec proves
  the fused contract equal to ordinary scaled dot product attention;
- *selective scan / Mamba support*: lower layer scan kernels support the Mamba recurrent path,
  while the higher layer keeps a pure CPU/CUDA compatible definition at the model API;
- *FFT and FNO kernels*: the FNO path uses cuFFT plus fused spectral multiplication and explicit
  backward kernels, with a dense CPU DFT reference kept for comparison;
- *sanitizer and parity harnesses*: the CUDA suite compares native kernels, stubs, finite-difference
  gradients, deterministic replay, and model-level examples.

That inventory matters because each item has a different agreement shape. Elementwise kernels can
be tied to pointwise `IEEE32Exec` assumptions. Reductions need an additional order assumption.
cuBLAS and cuFFT need vendor-library assumptions. Fused attention and FNO need both algorithmic
specs and FFI agreement.

The boundary can be read family by family:

- *Elementwise maps*: Lean-side meaning is `mapSpec` / `map2Spec`; native agreement is pointwise
  primitive-bit agreement; tests compare CUDA, stubs, and finite scalar cases.
- *Reductions and dot products*: Lean-side meaning is a fixed reduction spec such as
  `reduceSumLeftSpec`; native agreement must fix or document accumulation order; tests check
  deterministic reduction paths.
- *GEMM/BMM*: Lean-side meaning is `bmmSpec` plus row-major shape conventions; native agreement
  includes cuBLAS layout, accumulation, and FMA behavior; tests compare against CPU references.
- *Convolution and pooling*: Lean-side meaning is the tensor-index and VJP contract; native
  agreement covers indexing, padding, and layout; tests cover forward and backward paths.
- *FFT/FNO*: Lean-side meaning is the spectral convolution contract; native agreement covers cuFFT
  layout, normalization, and fused spectral multiplication; tests include dense DFT references and
  finite-difference checks.
- *Fused attention*: Lean-side meaning is the FlashAttention-style spec equal to SDPA; native
  agreement is that the fused CUDA kernel implements that fused spec; tests compare attention
  forward/backward behavior.

NVIDIA's floating-point notes emphasize the same practical issue: GPU arithmetic may follow
IEEE-style rules for individual operations, but fused multiply-add, parenthesization, thread counts,
library choices, and compute capability still affect a numerical claim. TorchLean keeps those cases
separate because they are separate assumptions.

# The Lean Side Contract

The CUDA boundary is not just "some C++ code was linked." The Lean side gives names to the pieces of
the contract.

```
import NN.Runtime.Autograd.Engine.Cuda.Float32Contract
import NN.Runtime.Autograd.Engine.Cuda.KernelSpec
import NN.Runtime.Autograd.Engine.Cuda.NativeSources

namespace Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Float32Contract
#check RefScalar
#check NativePrimitiveBits
#check NativePrimitiveAgreement
#check native_add_eq_ieee32
#check native_fma_eq_ieee32
#check native_add_abs_error_of_isFinite
#check native_sqrt_abs_error_of_isFinite
end Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Float32Contract

namespace Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.KernelSpec
#check FlatBuffer
#check NativeBitsBuffer
#check mapSpec
#check map2Spec
#check reduceSumLeftSpec
#check NativeReduceAgreement
#check bmmSpec
#check NativeBmmAgreement
end Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.KernelSpec
```

The idea is simple:

- `KernelSpec` says what owned kernels mean as pure finite-index computations.
- `Float32Contract` says how native primitive bits are expected to line up with `IEEE32Exec`.
- `NativeSources` keeps a Lean map from external symbols to source files under `csrc/cuda`.

This makes the CUDA contract small enough that a reader can find it, test it, and reason about the
runtime agreement being used.

# Assumptions, Axioms, And Runtime Agreement

When we say "axiom" for CUDA here, we mean an explicit named assumption, not an unrestricted claim
that any GPU result is correct. If a concrete native result satisfies the named agreement contract,
then Lean theorems can transport that result back into the proved float32/spec layer.

The most important named boundary is:

```
import NN.Runtime.Autograd.Engine.Cuda.Float32Contract

namespace Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Float32Contract
#check NativePrimitiveAgreement
#check native_mul_abs_error_of_isFinite
end Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Float32Contract
```

`NativePrimitiveAgreement` is the scalar assumption.  It says that native float32 primitive result
bits for add, multiply, divide, fused multiply-add, and square root match the executable
`IEEE32Exec` reference. Once that assumption holds, Lean can reuse the proved `IEEE32Exec` error
bounds. The theorem has the form: given bit agreement with the reference scalar operation, the
reference scalar operation has the proved binary32 error bound.

Lifting from scalar operations to kernels adds more assumptions:

- *elementwise kernels*: every output element's native bits must match the pointwise Lean spec;
- *fixed-order reductions*: the native accumulation order must match `reduceSumLeftSpec`, or a
  separate documented reduction spec must be used;
- *scatter-add and atomic reductions*: repeated indices and atomics are only bitwise deterministic
  under a fixed accumulation order; otherwise they are training kernels, not replay proofs;
- *BMM/GEMM*: row-major TorchLean buffers must be interpreted consistently around cuBLAS, and the
  accumulation/FMA behavior must match the selected reference contract if bitwise proof transport is
  desired;
- *cuFFT/FNO*: cuFFT normalization, half-spectrum layout, omitted modes, and real/imaginary weight
  layout are part of the native agreement contract;
- *FlashAttention style attention*: Lean proves the fused attention spec equals SDPA, while the
  native fused kernel is trusted/validated to implement that fused spec;
- *libdevice/transcendentals*: functions outside IEEE 754's basic arithmetic contract are treated as
  toolchain/library assumptions unless separately specified and tested.

The remaining runtime base is deliberately ordinary and visible: Lean's FFI marshalling, the C/CUDA
compiler, CUDA runtime and driver, GPU hardware, cuBLAS, cuFFT, libdevice, build flags, and the
source-to-binary path. Tests and sanitizer runs validate that base.

# Boundary Rationale

The CUDA decisions are deliberately conservative.

First, Lean owns the pieces it can inspect directly: shapes, indices, pure tensor specs, scalar
reference semantics, graph/IR semantics, and theorems that say "if native bits agree with this spec,
then the proved semantic result follows." Native code enters through the corresponding runtime
agreement.

Second, TorchLean still needs to run real models.  Proving every GPU instruction before using CUDA
would make the system unusable for training.  The compromise is a practical one: use CUDA for speed,
keep the mathematical contract in Lean, and require tests/sanitizers/parity checks at the boundary.

Third, we avoid silent semantic changes. CUDA is a runtime backend, not a new meaning for the model.
The same model API and IR should describe CPU eager, CUDA eager, and compiled execution.  That is why
we are careful about `--cuda`: it changes where work runs, not what the operation is supposed to
mean.

Fourth, we started with float32 because it is the smallest useful concrete target.  It covers the
training examples, has an executable `IEEE32Exec` bridge, and keeps the native-bit agreement
contract tractable. Float64, complex tensors, mixed precision, Tensor Cores, and approximate math modes
can be added later with equally explicit contracts.

Fifth, the fused kernels are correctness first. The attention kernel is "FlashAttention style"
because its contract is fused SDPA with a fused VJP. A stronger claim about a production IO-tiled
FlashAttention implementation would require a separate native-kernel proof or conformance story.

# What A CUDA Claim Means

Read CUDA claims at the right level:

- CUDA demo ran: the native path executed and produced values.
- CUDA parity test passed: the native path matched CPU, stub, or reference cases under the test
  conditions.
- Lean spec theorem: the pure Lean specification has the stated property.
- Runtime agreement assumption: native bits refine the Lean-side contract under stated conditions.
- Verified CUDA kernel: a proof about the compiled native kernel itself. This is future work rather
  than the current CUDA claim.

This vocabulary keeps extension points clear: verified layout proofs around more kernels, generated
proof obligations for FFI symbols, fixed-tree reductions for reproducibility, narrower
cuBLAS/cuFFT contracts, and future translation infrastructure for native kernels.

# Runtime Shape

At the Lean level, CUDA execution is a specialized eager tape, implemented by the
[CUDA runtime modules](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Engine/Cuda/):

```
Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Buffer
Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Tape
Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Tape.matmul
Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Tape.spectralConv1dRfft
```

The public training API usually hides those names.  A model zoo command such as

```
lake exe -K cuda=true torchlean resnet --cuda --n-total 20 --steps 1
```

still looks like an ordinary TorchLean run.  Under the hood, tensors are stored in CUDA buffers and
the local VJP rules call CUDA kernels.

This is still an eager runtime backend. Verification passes consume the shared IR described in
*Graphs and IR*; they do not verify a particular GPU schedule.

The runtime is explicit about CUDA buffer ownership. During eager training, each forward/backward
step creates tape values, gradient buffers, and local scratch buffers for kernels such as matmul,
convolution, normalization, attention, and FNO spectral convolution. The values returned to the
caller are kept; temporary buffers are released after their contribution has been consumed. This is
the practical reason the examples include allocator telemetry: if a future kernel holds on to
scratch state across steps, the terminal should show the trend before it becomes an allocation
failure. The same ownership rule is used by the public step-based model runners, so a long command
does not keep old per-step tensors merely because the loader loop continued.

In practice this gives TorchLean three related but distinct CUDA layers:

- *training layer*: run larger demos in Lean without waiting forever;
- *testing layer*: compare CUDA kernels against CPU stubs and reference cases;
- *proof layer*: state assumptions under which native float32 results can be transported back to the
  `IEEE32Exec` and `FP32` semantics defined in Lean.

Keeping those three layers separate prevents a common mistake: treating "the CUDA demo trained" as
"the CUDA implementation has been verified."

# Float32 Only

The CUDA backend is a float32 backend. Native buffers store C/CUDA `float`, and the Lean
FFI surface exposes them as opaque float32 buffers.  That choice is deliberate:

- it matches the common training precision for the examples;
- it keeps the bridge to `IEEE32Exec` and the float32 proof layer manageable;
- it avoids adding a partial complex or float64 layer before the runtime has a clean need for it.

Higher precision can be added later, but it should be a real design extension, not a couple of
duplicated kernels with unclear semantics.

# Randomness And Reproducibility

CUDA and CPU stubs share the same SplitMix64-based deterministic RNG contract.  For operations such
as `rand_uniform` and `bernoulli_mask`, both paths use the same low 32 bits of
`splitmix64(key + i)`.  This is tested because toggling CUDA should not silently change a seeded
experiment.

Reductions require a separate note.  Floating-point addition is not associative, so atomics may
produce order-dependent roundoff.  TorchLean therefore separates fast atomic reductions from
deterministic reduction paths where reproducibility matters.  The tests cover exact repeatability
for the deterministic paths.

# cuBLAS And cuFFT

TorchLean uses vendor libraries where that is the right engineering choice:

- cuBLAS for GEMM;
- cuFFT for real FFT and inverse real FFT;
- native kernels for layout, broadcasting, reductions, and fused model specific operations.

The FNO Burgers example is exactly why this distinction matters. The mathematical operation is
spectral convolution, the practical implementation uses cuFFT, and the proof story needs to know
which part is spec and which part is runtime agreement. The portable CPU path keeps a dense DFT
reference implementation. CUDA mode uses a fused real-FFT spectral convolution:

```
Runtime.Autograd.Cuda.Tape.spectralConv1dRfft
```

That op performs:

1. real FFT along the grid axis,
2. complex spectral multiplication with real/imaginary weights,
3. zeroing of omitted modes,
4. normalized inverse real FFT,
5. an explicit backward rule for input and spectral weights.

The tests include finite-difference checks for that backward rule and a tape-level gradient test.

# FlashAttention Style Fused Attention

Attention is the clearest example of why TorchLean separates a mathematical contract from a fast
backend implementation. On the Lean side, the fused attention spec is proved equal to ordinary
scaled dot product attention. On the runtime side, CUDA may call a fused native kernel that avoids
materializing the whole attention matrix. These are different claims: the first is a Lean semantic
equality, the second is native implementation agreement.

The proof contract is in the [FlashAttention API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Spec/Layers/FlashAttention.lean):

```
import NN.Spec.Layers.FlashAttention

namespace Spec
#check FlashAttentionConfig
#check flashAttention
#check flashAttentionBackward
#check onlineSoftmaxTiledAttention_eq_scaledDotProductAttention
#check flashAttention_eq_scaledDotProductAttention
#check flashAttentionBackward_eq_scaledDotProductAttentionBackward
#check cudaLoopFlashAttention_eq_scaledDotProductAttention
end Spec
```

Those names identify the contract:

- `FlashAttentionConfig` records tiling metadata as scheduling information.
- `flashAttention` is the fused forward contract.
- `flashAttentionBackward` is the fused VJP contract.
- the equality theorems say that the fused spec denotes ordinary scaled dot product attention.

The native runtime path is separate. The [CUDA kernel API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Engine/Cuda/Kernels.lean)
declares the FFI symbols, the
[native CUDA source](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/csrc/cuda/kernels/torchlean_cuda_kernels.cu) implements them, and the CPU
stub sits next to it in
[the CPU stub](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/csrc/cuda/kernels/torchlean_cuda_kernels_stub.c).

TorchLean's fused attention kernel is correctness-first: it implements the same masked,
stable scaled dot product attention contract and fused VJP interface, but it is not claiming to be
the production IO-tiled Dao-AILab kernel. The terminology in this guide is:

- *FlashAttention style contract* means the fused operator is specified as equal to SDPA.
- *Native fused attention kernel* means the CUDA backend calls external code through the FFI.
- *Verified CUDA FlashAttention* would require a proof about the native kernel, which TorchLean does
  not claim.

The regression test for this boundary is
[NN.Tests.Runtime.Cuda.Attention API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Tests/Runtime/Cuda/Attention.lean), which compares
CPU eager and CUDA eager multi-head attention forward/backward behavior and keeps the fused kernels
covered by the CUDA test suite.

# Proved Facts And Validated Behavior

A precise CUDA claim separates Lean proofs, runtime agreement, and validation evidence.

What Lean can prove:

- pure specifications for shapes, indexing, tensor operations, and selected kernel algorithms;
- float32 semantic facts about models defined in Lean, such as `IEEE32Exec` and `FP32`;
- correctness theorems for graph and autograd fragments that are represented inside Lean.

What tests validate:

- native CUDA kernels agree with CPU stubs and small reference cases;
- deterministic paths are repeatable;
- fused kernels have correct local VJP behavior on finite-difference checks;
- model examples learn on real data.

What remains trusted:

- the CUDA compiler, GPU hardware, CUDA runtime, cuBLAS, cuFFT, and libdevice;
- the FFI boundary between Lean and native code;
- toolchain flags and platform behavior.

That split is part of the contract. The boundary should be visible enough that a reader knows where
the theorem ends and the engineering validation begins.

# Common Failure Modes This Design Avoids

- *Silent CPU fallback.* Build-time CUDA selection and runtime `--cuda` selection are separate, so a
  missing native build should fail loudly.
- *Unstated nondeterminism.* Atomic reductions are called out explicitly, and deterministic
  reductions are available where reproducibility matters.
- *Confusing the verifier with the device runtime.* Verification consumes `NN.IR.Graph`; it does not
  inspect a GPU kernel schedule.
- *Assuming library calls are proved.* cuBLAS, cuFFT, libdevice, the CUDA compiler, and the driver
  remain external dependencies unless a future proof or checker discharges a narrower contract.
- *Collapsing every float32 path into one object.* `IEEE32Exec`, `FP32`, runtime `Float32`, and
  native CUDA `float` are related by named bridges and assumptions.

# Sanity Checklist

When changing CUDA code, run at least:

```
lake build NN.Tests.Runtime.Cuda.Fft
lake build -K cuda=true NN.Tests.Runtime.Cuda.Fft
lake exe nn_tests_suite
lake exe -K cuda=true nn_tests_suite
lake build -K cuda=true
```

After touching allocation, indexing, FFT, cuBLAS, convolution, or fused kernels, also run:

```
scripts/checks/cuda_sanitize_tests.sh
```

Use `--all-tools` for a slower pass that includes race, initialization, and synchronization checks.

For model changes, also run the relevant example. For the FNO path, the
[Burgers preparation helper](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Data/prepare_fno1d_burgers.py) downloads and converts
the data, and the [plot helper](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Data/plot_fno1d_burgers.py) renders a held-out
prediction:

```
python3 NN/Examples/Data/prepare_fno1d_burgers.py --download --grid 32 --ntrain 128 --ntest 32
lake exe -K cuda=true torchlean fno1d_burgers --cuda --fast-kernels --steps 700 --lr 0.003 \
  --plot-csv data/real/fno/predictions.csv
python3 NN/Examples/Data/plot_fno1d_burgers.py --csv data/real/fno/predictions.csv
```
