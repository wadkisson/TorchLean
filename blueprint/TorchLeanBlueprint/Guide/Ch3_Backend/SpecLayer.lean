The model we trained earlier can be written on one line:

$$`F_\theta(x)=W_2\,\operatorname{ReLU}(W_1x+b_1)+b_2.`

That formula is the mathematical center of the example. It says nothing about mutable buffers,
CUDA launches, PyTorch modules, reverse-mode tapes, or JSON files. It does say exactly how the four
parameter tensors and the input determine the output. TorchLean's `NN.Spec` library is where such
formulas live as Lean definitions.

The distinction is important because executable ML code changes form constantly. A linear layer
may be evaluated by a nested Lean function, a CPU loop, cuBLAS, or an ATen kernel. The specification
does not try to imitate those implementations. It gives them a common statement to implement.

# The Tensor Behind The Formula

A specification tensor is defined recursively from its shape:

- a scalar shape stores one value;
- a dimension of length `n` stores a function from `Fin n` to a smaller tensor.

Thus a vector of length two is, mathematically, two scalar values indexed by `Fin 2`; a matrix of
shape `[3, 2]` is three such vectors. The index type prevents an out-of-range lookup. It also makes
shape induction natural: a proof about an arbitrary tensor can follow the same scalar-or-dimension
recursion as the datatype.

This is not a claim that CUDA stores a matrix as nested Lean functions. Native runtimes use flat,
contiguous buffers. The specification chooses the representation that makes mathematical reasoning
clear; a layout contract is needed when an implementation flattens that value into memory.

The public aliases hide most of the recursive spelling:

```
import NN.Spec.Layers.Linear
import NN.Spec.Layers.Activation

open Spec
open Spec.Tensor

#check Tensor ℝ (shape![2])
#check Tensor ℝ (shape![3, 2])
#check LinearSpec ℝ 2 3
```

For a linear map from two inputs to three outputs,
`LinearSpec ℝ 2 3` contains

$$`W\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times 2},
\qquad b\in\mathbb{R}^{3}.`

The order is the same convention used by PyTorch's `nn.Linear`: output features index the rows of
the weight matrix.

# One Layer, Forward And Backward

The forward definition is deliberately short:

```
def linearSpec {α : Type} [Add α] [Mul α] [Zero α]
    {inDim outDim : Nat}
    (layer : LinearSpec α inDim outDim)
    (x : Tensor α (shape![inDim])) :
    Tensor α (shape![outDim]) :=
  addSpec (matVecMulSpec layer.weights x) layer.bias
```

At coordinate `i`, this means

$$`y_i=b_i+\sum_{j=0}^{\mathrm{inDim}-1}W_{ij}x_j.`

The backward specification receives an upstream cotangent
$g=\partial L/\partial y$ and returns

$$`
\frac{\partial L}{\partial W}=g\,x^\mathsf{T},\qquad
\frac{\partial L}{\partial b}=g,\qquad
\frac{\partial L}{\partial x}=W^\mathsf{T}g.
`

In Lean these three tensors have shapes `[outDim, inDim]`, `[outDim]`, and `[inDim]`. Returning a
transposed weight gradient by accident is therefore a type error rather than a numerically plausible
array.

The source definitions are
[`linearSpec`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Spec/Layers/Linear.lean)
and `linearBackwardSpec` in the same file. Later, the autograd proofs compare executable VJP rules
with these definitions. The existence of the definitions alone does not prove the comparison.

# The Complete MLP Meaning

The running model is the composition of two linear specifications and a pointwise activation:

```
def twoLayerMlp
    {α : Type} [Context α]
    {inDim hidden outDim : Nat}
    (first : LinearSpec α inDim hidden)
    (second : LinearSpec α hidden outDim)
    (x : Tensor α (shape![inDim])) :
    Tensor α (shape![outDim]) :=
  linearSpec second
    (Activation.reluSpec (linearSpec first x))
```

Expanding this definition gives the formula at the start of the chapter. No graph traversal or
runtime state is hidden inside it.

The ReLU definition commits to two choices:

$$`\operatorname{ReLU}(z)=\max(z,0),`

and for the selected derivative,

$$`\operatorname{ReLU}'(z)=
  \begin{cases}
    1 & z>0,\\
    0 & z\le 0.
  \end{cases}`

The value at the kink matters. Other subgradients are mathematically defensible, but a forward and
backward correctness theorem needs one concrete rule. TorchLean chooses zero at the kink, matching
the rule used by the current runtime path.

# Run The Same Formula

The quickest executable using this architecture is:

```
lake exe torchlean quickstart_mlp --device cpu --steps 200 --seed 2026
```

On the current example dataset it reports:

```
dataset size = 25
mean_loss(before) = 0.761530
mean_loss(after) = 0.003234
heldout x=(0.25,-0.75), target=0.2, prediction(after)=[0.210239]
```

The command executes runtime tensors and an autograd tape; it does not evaluate `twoLayerMlp` by
reducing the pure Lean definition above. The connection is made operation by operation:

1. the public `nn.linear` builder fixes the same parameter shapes;
2. its forward program emits the runtime linear operation;
3. the graph interpreter assigns `.linear` the `linearSpec` denotation;
4. the VJP proof identifies the selected backward rule with `linearBackwardSpec`;
5. a backend capsule records which native provider, if any, executed the operation.

This chain is why a specification is useful. It gives each bridge a stable target.

# Change One Value

The formula can be inspected without training. Take

$$`
W_1=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\-1&1\end{bmatrix},
\quad b_1=0,\quad
W_2=\begin{bmatrix}0.8&-0.4\end{bmatrix},
\quad b_2=0.2.
`

For $x=(0.25,-0.75)$,

$$`
W_1x=(-0.5,-1),\qquad
\operatorname{ReLU}(W_1x)=(0,0),
`

so the exact-real output is $0.2$. Change only the first bias to $0.6$. The first hidden
preactivation becomes $0.1$, and the output becomes

$$`0.8(0.1)+0.2=0.28.`

This tiny calculation is the same kind of reasoning used in interval propagation: replace one
point by a set of possible inputs, then bound every intermediate tensor.

# Scalar Polymorphism Is A Real Choice

The type parameter `α` determines what the symbols `+`, `*`, `max`, `exp`, and division mean.
TorchLean reuses the tensor structure at several scalar interpretations:

| Scalar | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `ℝ` | exact real arithmetic used for mathematical statements |
| `FP32` | finite binary32-grid values with a rounded-real proof model |
| `IEEE32Exec` | executable binary32 bit patterns, including signed zero, infinity, and NaN |
| interval contexts | sets of possible values, with outward enclosure operations |
| runtime `Float` | Lean's native executable floating-point value |

Writing one polymorphic definition is not a proof that these interpretations agree. For example,

$$`\operatorname{softmax}(x)_i=
\frac{\exp(x_i-m)}{\sum_j\exp(x_j-m)},\qquad m=\max_jx_j`

is a clean real-valued formula. A binary32 implementation introduces rounding in `max`,
subtraction, exponential approximation, summation, and division. A CUDA reduction may also choose
a different summation tree. The later floating-point and runtime-approximation chapters state the
conditions under which one interpretation encloses or approximates another.

# Conventions That Must Be In The Definition

Shapes are only one source of ambiguity. The spec layer also fixes choices that a model name does
not determine.

## Loss reductions

`mseSpec` takes a global mean over all entries. Cross-entropy over logits applies log-softmax on the
final class axis and averages over the remaining slices. Changing `mean` to `sum` changes both the
loss and every gradient by a scale factor.

## Attention masks

A boolean attention mask is a hard support constraint:

- `true` allows the key;
- `false` gives the key exactly zero softmax numerator;
- if every key in a row is blocked, the output row is zero.

This is the finite formulation of a negative-infinity mask. It is not an additive score bias of
`-1000` or any other finite sentinel. For sufficiently large logits a finite sentinel can leak
nonzero probability into a blocked position; the hard-mask definition cannot.

## Dropout

Randomness is explicit. A masked dropout specification receives the mask as an argument.
Runtime training code may generate that mask from a seed and tape state, but the semantic function
does not consult hidden global randomness.

## Invalid windows

Some mathematical operations are total where the runtime is partial. A convolution output extent
is normally

$$`\left\lfloor\frac{n+2p-k}{s}\right\rfloor+1.`

The shape helper defines an answer even around invalid kernel or stride configurations, while the
runtime validator rejects unsupported calls before reaching native code. A total denotation and an
admission check answer different questions.

# A Proof Checkpoint

GraphSpec's checked MLP uses the same four parameter tensors:

```
[W₁ : shape![hidden, input],
 b₁ : shape![hidden],
 W₂ : shape![output, hidden],
 b₂ : shape![output]]
```

The theorem
`NN.GraphSpec.Models.mlp_interp_eq_spec_mlp_forward` proves that interpreting that GraphSpec model
is equal to the hand-written two-layer specification. Its conclusion is about two pure meanings.
It does not mention the eager tape, CUDA, or an imported checkpoint, so it should not be reported as
a proof of those objects.

That scope is not a weakness. It is the first exact link in a longer chain, and it prevents later
engineering layers from silently changing what “the MLP” means.

The next chapter turns these formulas into typed architectures with explicit parameter layouts.
