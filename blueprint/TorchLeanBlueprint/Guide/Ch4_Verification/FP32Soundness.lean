The previous floating-point pages named the numerical objects. This page explains how a claim moves
from real arithmetic to Float32.

The basic situation is common. A verifier or proof establishes a real-valued inequality with some
margin. A floating-point analysis bounds how far the rounded computation can move from the real one.
If the margin is larger than the rounding error budget, the property survives finite precision.

Recurring vocabulary:

- `FP32`: TorchLean's proof model for binary32 style rounding on the reals.
- `IEEE32Exec`: the executable IEEE-754 kernel, useful for checking actual bit behavior.
- `bound/approximation theorem`: a theorem of the form "the float32 execution stays within `eps`
  of the real spec".
- `soundness`: the claim that a proof side bound actually covers the runtime behavior being
  modeled.

The guiding transfer lemma is simple:

- the decoded FP32 result is within `ε` of the real specification;
- the real specification is above the target threshold by more than `ε`;
- therefore the decoded FP32 result is still above the target threshold.

A real-valued margin of `10^-4` is not useful if the Float32 error budget is `10^-3`. A real-valued
margin of `0.1` may survive the same rounding budget. The theorem has to say which case we are in.

For example, suppose a real-valued verifier proves a margin lower bound of `0.12`. Suppose the FP32
approximation theorem says each relevant logit can move by at most `0.03`. For a two-logit margin,
the margin can shrink by at most `0.06`. The FP32 margin is still at least `0.06`, so the
classification claim survives rounding.

# Finite Path First

TorchLean deliberately separates two questions:

1. What happens on the ordinary finite path, where every operation produces a finite float32 value?
2. What happens for every IEEE-754 corner case, including NaN, Inf, subnormal behavior, signed zero,
   and backend-specific library behavior?

The `FP32` model used in proofs is aimed at the first question. It is the right object for margin
transfer theorems, forward error bounds, and verifier enclosure inflation. The executable
`IEEE32Exec` model is the right object for bit level behavior and for checking what the runtime
does. Bridge theorems and explicit assumptions connect the two where the finite side conditions are
available.

This is a practical mathematical choice. If every robustness theorem had to carry the full IEEE
state machine directly, most theorem statements would become harder to read than the property they
are trying to prove.

The finite path includes normal values and subnormals. It excludes computations whose executable
path produces NaN or infinity. For example, a small underflowed subnormal output may still be a
finite value covered by a finite-path theorem, while `0/0`, overflow to `Inf`, or `sqrt` of a
negative finite value are handled by the executable `IEEE32Exec` layer and total `toReal?` bridge,
not by pretending they are ordinary real numbers.

# Proof Float32 Model

`FP32` is the clean proof model for finite-path error budgets. `IEEE32Exec` is the executable bit
model for special values and edge cases. Bridge theorems connect them when the computation remains
finite.

In TorchLean, `FP32` serves as the model for binary32-style rounding on the finite path.

More concretely:

- `TorchLean.Floats.FP32` in [NN.Floats.FP32 API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Floats/FP32.lean) is the canonical
  float32 semantics for proofs:
  a rounded real model instantiated to binary radix, binary32 style exponent (`fexp32`), and
  round-to-nearest-even (`rnd32`).
- It is smaller than full executable IEEE semantics by design. It does not try to represent NaN,
  Inf, or signed-zero behavior directly.
- For the executable layer, `IEEE32Exec` is used, with bridge theorems to relate it to `FP32` and to say
  when the executable computation agrees with the proof model.

Executable IEEE-754-style float32 starts at the
[IEEE32Exec semantics API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Floats/IEEEExec/Exec32.lean). Bridge and soundness theorems
connect that executable view to the standardized [FP32 proof semantics API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Floats/FP32.lean),
which is still the model we prefer for clean paper-level claims.

This division matters because paper claims usually want the cleanest theorem statement first:

- the proof model gives a theorem about rounding error and interval enclosure,
- the executable model gives a checkable implementation account,
- and the bridge theorems say when the executable and proof views coincide on the finite path.

So the relevant claim is never just "Float32 is close." It is a statement with an
interpretation map:

$$`\operatorname{IEEE32Exec}
\xrightarrow{\operatorname{toReal}}
\mathbb{R}
\quad\text{and}\quad
\operatorname{FP32}
\xrightarrow{\operatorname{toReal}}
\mathbb{R}`

plus hypotheses saying the values are finite and the rounded executable path agrees with the proof
model being cited.

# Where The Approximation Story Becomes Concrete

The repository turns this picture into named theorems in three recurring settings: layerwise error bounds, small network-level bounds for
common MLP families, and verifier side statements saying that real valued enclosures can be widened
enough to remain sound for float32 execution.

Theorem names that tend to matter first in this area:

- `approxT_linear_fp32`: float aware forward error for `y = Wx + b`
- `approxT_tanhMlp3_fp32` / `approxT_reluMlp2_fp32`: float aware forward error for common MLP
  patterns
- `fp32_le_of_real_le_sub_margin` / `fp32_ge_of_real_ge_add_margin`: margin lemmas for lifting
  real-spec inequalities
- `ibpBound_contains_reluMlp2_fp32`: inflate a real IBP/CROWN box to cover FP32 execution of the
  two-layer ReLU MLP fragment

Behind those statements sit more generic rounded-runtime lemmas for operators and linear algebra.
Those are the engine room for the more visible theorems:

- they keep the algebra of rounding explicit,
- they make it easy to reuse the same proof pattern across many operators,
- and they let the FP32 semantics guide stay focused on the model rather than every proof detail.

# One Transfer Pattern

Most theorems in this area follow a repeatable proof pattern:

1. Prove or compute a real-spec enclosure or inequality with a margin.
2. Use `approxT_*` to obtain an explicit `eps` such that the float32 semantics is within `eps`.
3. Apply a margin lemma like `fp32_le_of_real_le_sub_margin` or
   `fp32_ge_of_real_ge_add_margin` to transfer the property to FP32 execution.

The kind of theorem TorchLean aims at looks like this:

```
import NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32.Layers
import NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32.MLP
import NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32.CROWN

open NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32

-- If the real valued network stays above a threshold by more than `eps`,
-- then the FP32-rounded execution still stays above the threshold.
#check approxT_linear_fp32
#check approxT_reluMlp2_fp32
#check approxT_tanhMlp3_fp32
#check ibpBound_contains_reluMlp2_fp32
#check fp32_le_of_real_le_sub_margin
#check fp32_ge_of_real_ge_add_margin
```

That is the shape to keep in mind when reading the declarations. One theorem gives the approximation
error, and another theorem uses that approximation error to preserve the property one actually
cares about.

The recurring scalar pattern is:

$$`|y^{\mathrm{fp32}} - y^{\mathbb R}| \le \varepsilon`

and

$$`y^{\mathbb R} \ge t + \varepsilon`

therefore

$$`y^{\mathrm{fp32}} \ge t`

For classifier margins, the same idea is applied componentwise: the true logit may move down, the
competing logit may move up, and the certified real margin must pay for both movements.

For a vector output, the same pattern is componentwise:

$$`\forall i,\quad
\left| y^{fp32}_i - y^{real}_i \right| \le \varepsilon_i`

and a classifier margin proof normally spends that budget on the true class and the competing
classes before concluding that the argmax is unchanged.

# Template Statement

The most useful mental model here is a transfer lemma with explicit side conditions:

> Assume a real valued network output stays above a threshold by margin `δ`.
> Assume the corresponding FP32 execution stays within error `ε`.
> If `ε < δ`, then the FP32 execution still stays above the threshold.

TorchLean splits that argument into reusable pieces instead of reproving it from scratch every time:

- one theorem gives the forward approximation error,
- one theorem packages verifier side enclosure inflation,
- and one margin lemma moves the property across the `ε` gap.

That is why this theorem family matters beyond small MLP examples. The same pattern shows up again
in layerwise proofs, in verifier side corollaries, and in the kinds of robustness statements one
would actually want to cite in a paper.

In theorem statements, this usually appears as three named ingredients:

- a real-valued property or enclosure;
- an approximation relation such as `approxT_*`;
- a margin lemma such as `fp32_ge_of_real_ge_add_margin`.

# A Concrete Linear Layer Walkthrough

The linear theorem is the smallest useful example because it already has the same ingredients as a
network:

1. real tensors and real parameters define the ideal layer `y = Wx + b`;
2. FP32 tensors and FP32 parameters define the rounded layer;
3. `approxT_linear_fp32` supplies the output error budget;
4. a verifier or margin lemma spends that budget against the property we want.

```
import NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32.Layers

open NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32

#check approxT_linear_fp32
#check fp32_le_of_real_le_sub_margin
#check fp32_ge_of_real_ge_add_margin
```

The important point is that the result is not "linear layers are close" as prose. The theorem names
the input approximation, parameter approximation, output tolerance, and scalar semantics. Larger MLP
and CROWN statements reuse that shape.

# How The FP32 Theorems Fit The Tensor Implementation

The theorem names above are not isolated scalar lemmas. They sit on top of the same tensor and layer
specifications used elsewhere in TorchLean:

- `LinearSpec ℝ inDim outDim` is the real valued layer specification.
- `LinearSpec FP32.R inDim outDim` is the rounded-runtime layer at the proof scalar.
- `Tensor R s` is still a TorchLean tensor; only the scalar semantics changed.
- `approxT` is the relation saying the interpreted runtime tensor is within a tolerance of the
  real tensor, componentwise in the relevant norm.

The linear theorem is therefore a real implementation bridge, not just a scalar exercise:

```
import NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32.Layers

open NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32

-- Real linear layer and FP32 linear layer are related by an explicit output budget.
#check approxT_linear_fp32
```

The MLP theorems compose that layer theorem with rounded activations:

```
import NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32.MLP

open NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32

-- Whole-network approximation statements for common examples.
#check approxT_reluMlp2_fp32
#check approxT_tanhMlp3_fp32
```

Then the CROWN/IBP theorem widens a real valued verification box so it also contains the interpreted
FP32 output:

```
import NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32.CROWN

open NN.Proofs.RuntimeApprox.FP32

#check ibpBound_contains_reluMlp2_fp32
```

That is the intended user workflow: train or import a model, lower or specify its tensor computation,
prove/check a real valued enclosure, and then spend an explicit FP32 error budget to keep the
checked claim connected to rounded execution.

# Proof Model Versus IEEE Execution

The rounded-real `FP32` model has a narrower, reusable analysis interface. The
bit-level `IEEE32Exec` model handles NaN, infinity, signed zeros, and executable binary32 behavior.
The bridge theorems connect the two on the finite path.

# What People Usually Cite

Usually the right answer is:

- `FP32` for the proof model,
- `IEEE32Exec` for executable bit behavior,
- and `NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/*` for the theorem family that turns real bounds into float aware
  bounds.

For the float model split, read *Floating-Point Semantics*. For how these bounds plug into tools,
read *Verification*.
