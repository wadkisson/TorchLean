tag := "proof-systems-beyond-bounds"

This page is the bridge from "verification means bounds" to "verification means checked
relationships between artifacts and semantics."

IBP and CROWN are about enclosing outputs. Compiler correctness is about preserving graph meaning.
Autograd correctness is about derivatives. Runtime approximation is about finite precision.
BugZoo contracts are about making common ML failure modes precise. These are different proof
systems, but they follow the same discipline: name the object, state the relation, and prove or
check the relation for the supported fragment.

# Comparison With ML Frameworks

PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow, XLA, TVM, CUDA, Gymnasium, and α,β-CROWN are excellent tools. TorchLean is
not treating those tools as a problem. The important difference is where the mathematical claim is
stated.

- *PyTorch autograd*: ordinary use relies on the dynamic autograd engine and kernels; TorchLean proves
  local VJP/JVP laws and then global backprop correctness for a supported tape/graph fragment.
- *`torch.compile` and graph lowering*: ordinary use relies on compiler passes plus regression tests;
  TorchLean proves that successful lowering from IR to executable graph preserves denotation for
  supported ops.
- *CUDA kernels*: ordinary use relies on native code, vendor libraries, and tests; TorchLean keeps
  CUDA attached to Lean specs and explicit runtime agreement statements.
- *α,β-CROWN*: ordinary use relies on external optimization/search or checks solver outputs informally;
  TorchLean parses or recomputes selected certificate steps and names the remaining oracle boundary.
- *Gymnasium/RL environments*: ordinary use relies on Python environment records; TorchLean can check
  emitted transition records against a Lean boundary contract.
- *Float32 execution*: ordinary use relies on backend arithmetic; TorchLean connects executable
  binary32 semantics, intervals, and explicit approximation theorems where the bridge is present.

That is the recurring TorchLean pattern:

1. name the semantic object;
2. run or import an artifact;
3. check the artifact against the semantic object;
4. prove that the check implies the intended claim;
5. leave native or external pieces as explicit assumptions when they are not proved.

# IRExec Correctness: The Big Compiler Theorem

The theorem to care about first is:

```
Runtime.Autograd.Compiled.execGraphOfIR_semantics_eq
```

The declaration is in the
[IR execution correctness API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Compiled/IRExec/Correctness/SemanticEquivalence.lean).

In plain English:

> If `execGraphOfIR` successfully compiles an `NN.IR.Graph` and payload into executable compiled
> graph data, then evaluating the compiled graph on any input gives the same value table as the
> Lean denotational evaluator for the original IR graph.

The theorem connects three objects:

- `NN.IR.Graph.denoteAll`: the reference denotational semantics of the tagged op IR.
- `execGraphOfIR`: the compiler from IR to executable compiled graph data.
- `ExecGraphData.denoteAll`: the compiled runtime evaluator.

The theorem shape is: if `execGraphOfIR g payload` returns `ok exec`, then for every input `x`,
the value table produced by `ExecGraphData.denoteAll exec x` is the same value table produced by
`NN.IR.Graph.denoteAll g payload x`.

In theorem notation, the supported-fragment statement has the shape:

$$`\operatorname{execGraphOfIR}(G,P)=\operatorname{ok}(E)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\forall x,\;
\operatorname{ExecGraphData.denoteAll}(E,x)
=
\operatorname{Graph.denoteAll}(G,P,x)`

This is the theorem that prevents "verified the wrong executable graph" for the covered IRExec
fragment.

There are side conditions, and they matter. The graph must pass the structural checks, compilation
must succeed, and the current theorem has an explicit `NoMSELoss g` side condition because that op is
not in this semantic equivalence proof path yet. That precision is part of the compiler proof:
supported ops get named coverage, and unsupported ops or ops not moved yet do not get folded into
the theorem.

Why this is important:

- In PyTorch or XLA style compilation, we usually rely on the compiler and test for regressions.
- In TorchLean's supported IRExec fragment, the compiler's forward result is tied to the IR
  denotation by a Lean theorem.
- This directly targets the classic silent wrong code problem: the optimized/executable graph
  should not secretly compute a different mathematical program.

The proof is large because it recursively mirrors the compiler. The workhorse lemma is
`buildFrom_preserves_denotation`: as the compiler walks node ids and extends the compiled graph, the
IR value table and compiled context stay aligned. Each operator branch proves one local
preservation fact, then the recursive theorem stitches the branch into the whole graph.

The current proof is split for auditability:

- The [IRExec common API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Compiled/IRExec/Correctness/Common.lean) contains shared
  infrastructure for dynamic values, compiled contexts, and finishing a node step.
- The [semantic equivalence common API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Compiled/IRExec/Correctness/SemanticEquivalenceCommon.lean)
  contains helper lemmas used by the recursive proof.
- The [semantic equivalence op cases API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Compiled/IRExec/Correctness/SemanticEquivalenceOpCases.lean)
  contains heavy named cases such as `.linear` and `.conv2d`.
- `Correctness/Ops/*` contains smaller branches by op family: activations, constants, elementwise,
  linear algebra, normalization, pooling, permutation, random, reductions, structural ops, and unary
  ops.
- The [semantic equivalence theorem API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/Autograd/Compiled/IRExec/Correctness/SemanticEquivalence.lean)
  ties the cases together into `execGraphOfIR_semantics_eq`.

This is one of the places where TorchLean is genuinely doing something stronger than a normal ML
framework. A regression test says "we tried these examples." The theorem says "for every input, if
the supported compiler accepts this graph, the compiled evaluator and IR denotation agree."

# A Tiny IRExec Example

Imagine an IR graph for:

$$`y=\operatorname{ReLU}(Wx+b)`

There are two ways to evaluate it:

1. Interpret the IR directly:

- input node `0` gives `x`;
- linear node `1` reads `W` and `b` from the payload and computes `Wx+b`;
- ReLU node `2` computes `max(0,node1)`.

2. Compile the IR into `ExecGraphData` and run the compiled graph:

- compiled node `1` has a forward closure for the affine map;
- compiled node `2` has a forward closure for ReLU;
- the compiled evaluator visits the same dependency order as the IR denotation.

The theorem says these two paths produce the same result for every `x`, provided the compiler
accepted the graph and the ops are in the proved fragment. At that boundary, the compiled runtime
stops being "some other implementation" and becomes a proved refinement of the IR semantics.

# Autograd: From Runtime Gradients To VJP Theorems

PyTorch autograd is a very successful engineering system. In ordinary PyTorch use, the engine and
the derivative kernels supply the gradient path. If a custom op registers the wrong backward rule,
PyTorch may execute it perfectly and still return the wrong gradient.

TorchLean splits autograd into proof layers:

- *Local op rules*: each primitive VJP/JVP is the correct adjoint or derivative rule.
- *Tape and graph soundness*: composing locally correct nodes yields globally correct backprop.
- *Analytic bridge*: graph backprop equals the adjoint of the Fréchet derivative.
- *Model bridges*: attention, LayerNorm, Transformer sublayers, recurrent cells, and MLP losses can
  reuse the graph theorem.
- *Training algebra*: scalar loss gradients feed optimizer style updates explicitly.

The local correctness APIs, such as
[real autograd correctness](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/Core/RealCorrectness.lean) and
[semiring autograd correctness](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/Core/SemiringCorrectness.lean), prove
primitive derivative rules. The global tape APIs, such as
[tape algebra soundness](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/Tape/Algebra/Soundness.lean) and
[Fréchet derivative soundness](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/Tape/Core/FDeriv.lean), lift those rules
to whole graphs. Model and training APIs, such as
[MLP/MSE derivative facts](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/FDeriv/MlpMse.lean) and
[training step algebra](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/Training/StepAlgebra.lean), specialize the theorem
to concrete losses and optimizer style updates.

A helpful way to say the contrast is:

> PyTorch gives us `loss.backward()`. TorchLean proves, for supported graph fragments,
> that the reverse pass computes the adjoint of the derivative of the forward denotation.

That is a large conceptual difference. The theorem is not "gradients looked plausible on a test
batch." It is a mathematical statement about the whole graph, under the stated operator/domain
conditions.

The central equation is the adjoint law:

$$`\left\langle \operatorname{JVP}_G(x;\dot x),\bar y\right\rangle
=
\left\langle \dot x,\operatorname{VJP}_G(x;\bar y)\right\rangle`

Once this is proved locally for primitive nodes and lifted through the graph, reverse mode becomes a
theorem about the graph denotation rather than just an execution trace.

# Autograd Proofs For Model Blocks

The autograd proof tree is not limited to scalar examples. We also have proof surfaces for model families.

Examples:

- The [softmax derivative API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/FDeriv/Softmax.lean) proves the derivative and adjoint
  identities behind softmax.
- The [log-softmax derivative API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/FDeriv/LogSoftmax.lean) records the log-softmax
  derivative account used by stable losses.
- The [attention proof API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Proofs/Models/Attention/) contains attention invariants such as
  weight normalization and causal mask properties.
- The [Transformer post-norm API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/Tape/Ops/Transformer/PostNorm.lean) contains
  post-norm Transformer sublayer VJP theorems and the bridge theorem for two sublayers with post norm
  blocks.
- The [Elman cell API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/Autograd/Tape/Ops/Recurrent/ElmanCell.lean) gives a
  recurrent theorem for one cell and explains that full BPTT is the next induction over the unroll.

That last phrase matters because it separates proved fragments from open work. A theorem for one
cell is not the same as a full theorem for a sequence model. A Transformer sublayer theorem is not
the same as all of GPT-2. The value is that TorchLean makes those boundaries precise instead of
using one broad "autograd works" phrase for everything.

# Runtime Approximation: Real Proofs Are Not Float Proofs

A common mistake in ML verification is to prove something over real numbers and then deploy Float32
code as if no bridge were needed. TorchLean has a separate runtime approximation tree because we do
not want to blur that boundary.

The key idea is an approximation relation:

$$`runtimeValue \approx_{\varepsilon} specValue`

For tensors, read this as a componentwise or normed error budget:

$$`\left\|\operatorname{toSpec}(y_{\mathrm{runtime}})-y_{\mathrm{spec}}\right\|_\infty
\le \varepsilon`

Then each op gets a rule for how its error budget propagates. Forward graphs, backward graphs,
convolutions, reductions, softmax axis rules, and scale aware tolerances all live in this layer.

The [runtime approximation core](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/Core/) defines tolerances and
spec/runtime approximation relations. The
[forward graph approximation API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/Graph/ForwardApprox.lean) and
[backward graph approximation API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/Graph/BackwardApprox.lean)
propagate those relations through graph execution. The
[normal form operator API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/NF/Ops.lean),
[convolution forward API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/NF/ConvForward.lean), and
[convolution backward API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/NF/ConvBackward.lean) give the operator
cases. The [scale approximation API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/Scale/) adds absolute and
relative tolerance tracking, and the
[FP32 CROWN bridge API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RuntimeApprox/FP32/CROWN.lean) connects approximation
budgets to verifier margins.

This is the right way to talk about deployment:

- a theorem over the reals says what the ideal spec does;
- a runtime approximation theorem says the executable path stays within a tolerance;
- an FP32 or CUDA boundary says which scalar/kernel assumptions remain.

# Reinforcement Learning: MDPs, PPO, Replay, And Boundaries

The RL stack is another place where TorchLean should say more than "we implemented PPO."
The codebase has both runtime RL tools and MDP facts in Lean.

Runtime side:

- [NN.Runtime.RL.Core API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/RL/Core.lean) defines transition and rollout data.
- [NN/Runtime/RL/PPO](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Runtime/RL/PPO/) covers PPO rollout collection.
- [NN/Runtime/RL/PolicyGradient](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Runtime/RL/PolicyGradient/) contains policy gradient and
  PPO objective code.
- [NN.Runtime.RL.Replay API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Runtime/RL/Replay.lean) defines replay buffers.
- [NN/Runtime/RL/Gymnasium](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Runtime/RL/Gymnasium/) is the external Python environment
  boundary.

Proof side:

- [NN.Proofs.RL.MDP API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RL/MDP.lean) and
  the [finite stochastic MDP API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RL/FiniteStochasticMDP.lean) prove monotonicity,
  contraction, uniqueness, and fixed point/error facts for Bellman operators.
- [NN.Proofs.RL.Envs.GridWorld API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RL/Envs/GridWorld.lean) proves simple
  GridWorld transition facts and bridges deterministic successors to finite stochastic MDP rows.
- [NN.Proofs.RL.Replay API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RL/Replay.lean) proves structural properties of replay
  buffer push/size behavior.
- [NN/Proofs/RL/Floats](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Proofs/RL/Floats/) connects discounted backups and TD residuals to
  executable float32 formulas under explicit finiteness checks.
- [NN.Proofs.RL.Boundary API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Proofs/RL/Boundary.lean) proves facts about checked boundary
  contracts.

Compared with ordinary Gymnasium usage, the difference is again the boundary. A Python environment
can return an observation and reward; TorchLean can additionally check that a transition record has
the expected shape/action/reward contract before treating it as evidence on a path toward a theorem.

# Generative Models: Objectives, Samplers, And What Is Actually Proved

TorchLean has generative model examples and theory declarations, with a kept narrow claim:
the current formal layer does not prove that a trained diffusion model generates good images. It
does provide exact specifications and theorem fragments for the mathematical pieces that these
models use.

Theory APIs:

- [NN.MLTheory.Generative.Diffusion API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/Generative/Diffusion.lean) collects the
  diffusion theory surface.
- The [forward Gaussian API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/Generative/Diffusion/ForwardGaussian.lean) states that
  affine forward noising of a standard Gaussian remains Gaussian.
- The [diffusion samplers API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/Generative/Diffusion/Samplers.lean) records boundary and
  dynamics adapter facts for DDPM/DDIM/probability flow style samplers.
- The [VAE theory API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/Generative/Latent/VAE.lean) proves ELBO/KL style structural
  facts such as nonnegativity of the diagonal Gaussian KL to a standard normal.
- The [VQ-VAE theory API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/Generative/Latent/VQVAE.lean) proves nearest code and
  quantization loss facts.
- The [GAN theory API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/Generative/Latent/GAN.lean) records generator/discriminator
  loss decompositions.

Executable examples:

- [NN.Examples.Models.Generative.Diffusion API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Models/Generative/Diffusion.lean)
- [autoencoder example API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Models/Generative/Autoencoder.lean)
- [VAE example API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Models/Generative/Vae.lean)
- [VQ-VAE example API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Models/Generative/VqVae.lean)
- [GAN example API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Models/Generative/Gan.lean)

The precise wording is:

> TorchLean can run small generative examples and prove selected objective/sampler facts. That is not a
> claim of full generative model quality, distributional convergence, or production sampler
> correctness for every native kernel.

# Learning Theory: DP, Stability, Robustness

The learning theory pages name definitions that mainstream ML code usually keeps in papers or
README prose. The
[differential privacy core](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/LearningTheory/DifferentialPrivacy/Core.lean) defines
`(ε, δ)` differential privacy over events using `ProbabilityMeasure`, then proves monotonicity in
`δ` and closure under post processing. The
[stability core](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/LearningTheory/Stability/Core.lean) defines supervised learning
stability over typed datasets. The
[ridge regression theorem API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/MLTheory/LearningTheory/Stability/RidgeRegression1D/)
gives a worked stability theorem with real and `IEEE32Exec` versions. The
[robustness spec API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/LearningTheory/Robustness/Spec.lean) names perturbation and
robustness predicates, while the
[robustness runtime API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/MLTheory/LearningTheory/Robustness/Runtime.lean) gives
deterministic diagnostics without treating sampled attacks as certificates.

This material is closer to mathematical ML theory than to runtime training. Definitions such as
"DP is preserved under post processing" or "this Bellman operator is a contraction" belong in the
theory layer, not buried inside model examples.

# BugZoo: Real Bugs As Checked Contracts

BugZoo is one of the most teachable parts of TorchLean because it connects formal methods to bugs
ML engineers already recognize.

The [BugZoo API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Examples/BugZoo/) and
[BugZoo overview](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/BugZoo/README.md) map each example to real bug families.

- *Attention mask*: causal or future positions receive exactly zero attention weight under hard
  mask semantics.
- *KV cache*: appending a key/value makes that key/value the final cache entry.
- *RoPE position*: appending a decode token assigns the next position, avoiding position mismatch.
- *Tokenizer boundary*: token ids are `Fin vocabSize`, so out-of-vocabulary ids are not
  representable in the checked fragment.
- *Stable loss*: stable losses and safe domains are named instead of relying on backend numerics.
- *Ignored labels*: ignored labels contribute zero, including the case where all labels are ignored.
- *Normalization state*: BatchNorm epsilon placement and eval-time running stats become explicit.
- *Shape and broadcast*: intended axes and broadcasts become named shape operations.
- *Compiler boundary*: accepted backends must match source semantics.
- *Float boundary*: runtime Float32 ops are tied to explicit IEEE style semantics.

This gives a concrete comparison to ordinary frameworks:

- PyTorch usually catches these through tests, bug reports, runtime warnings, and regression suites.
- TorchLean turns the intended behavior into a small spec or theorem so the failure mode has a
  stable regression target.

# Widgets: Proofs Need Human Debugging Too

Widgets are not proofs, but they matter because proof engineering and verifier debugging are
painful without visual feedback.

The [widgets API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Widgets/) gives readable views of proof and runtime artifacts:

- IR graph views show node ids, shapes, op kinds, and execution traces.
- Runtime autograd widgets show tapes, gradients, and reverse traversal.
- CROWN widgets show bound propagation and tightness.
- Float32 widgets show the semantics of executable numeric values.
- RL widgets show trajectories and PPO/GridWorld artifacts.
- Training widgets show logs and metric traces.

The important rule is:

> A widget does not create a theorem. It helps us inspect the same Lean object that a theorem or
> checker may later consume.

That is why widgets belong in the proof layer. They are the human interface to artifacts that would
otherwise be unreadable arrays, graph contexts, or certificate JSON.

# Model Zoo: Runtime Breadth, Not Theorem Overclaiming

The model examples show breadth:

- MLP, CNN, ViT, plus residual/ResNet block specs;
- RNN, LSTM, Transformer, GPT examples, Mamba;
- diffusion, VAE, VQ-VAE, GAN;
- FNO/Burgers operator learning;
- DQN and PPO examples.

Not every model has a full correctness theorem. The examples share the same API, runtime, graph,
CUDA, data, and verification boundaries as the theorem files. That is the bridge we want: the
formal abstractions are tested against realistic ML shapes instead of living only in small proof
snippets.

# Where To Go Next

- *Reinforcement Learning Stack* covers MDP proofs, PPO runtime objects, Gymnasium boundaries, and
  float32 diagnostics.
