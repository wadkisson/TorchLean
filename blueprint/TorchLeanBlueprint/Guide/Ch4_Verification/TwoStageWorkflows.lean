Two-stage workflows are for cases where search is too expensive or too specialized to do inside
Lean, but the final claim should still be checked as a small artifact.

The first stage is a producer: Python, Julia, α,β-CROWN, or a control script trains a model,
searches for a certificate, or partitions a domain. The second stage is a Lean checker: it parses
the artifact, checks the supported conditions, and records exactly what follows.

TorchLean does not vendor the Two-Stage / α,β-CROWN repository. The core TorchLean library and
`lake build` do not require that Python environment. If you want to run the external producer workflow,
clone the Two-Stage repository separately. TorchLean no longer carries that producer as a submodule.

The workflow has two stages, each with a few concrete steps:

```
Stage 1: external search or training
  PyTorch / Julia / α,β-CROWN
  -> checkpoint, bounds, raw leaf data, controller candidate

Stage 2: Lean post-check
  parse artifact
  check shape and schema
  replay supported computation
  validate certificate predicate
  state theorem or producer hypothesis
```

In repository terms, the stages are:

- Python training, Julia simulation, or α,β-CROWN produces a checkpoint, raw artifact, terminal
  domain dump, or bound report.
- TorchLean parses the artifact into typed Lean data.
- A TorchLean checker replays the supported computation, checks structure, or records an explicit
  producer hypothesis.
- The final report says which part was proved in Lean, which part was recomputed, and which part
  remains external evidence.

# Scope

Below is how TorchLean connects Python training and α,β-CROWN runs to Lean replay and
checking. For flags and solver options on the Python side, follow the Two-Stage repository; those
details change independently of TorchLean.

To run a verifier tool, use `lake exe verify -- list` and the tool names in
[NN.Verification.CLI API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Verification/CLI.lean), then read the sections here for
what Lean actually checks.

# What TorchLean Provides

TorchLean supports the verification pattern where Python writes an artifact first: Lean parses,
replays, or structurally checks it. The current Two Stage checker handles a small leaf artifact JSON
format converted from terminal domain data produced by α,β-CROWN:
`abcrown-leaf` (see the certificate guide for what this does and does not check).

# Running the Checker From TorchLean

The Two Stage checker is registered in the unified verification CLI. Start by listing the available
verification commands:

```
lake exe verify -- list
```

For debugging certificate export and import, the leaf checker is the usual starting point:

```
lake exe verify -- abcrown-leaf
```

# Minimal Setup (One-Time)

Clone the external producer only if you want to generate fresh α,β-CROWN / Two-Stage artifacts:

- `git clone https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/Two-Stage_Neural_Controller_Training.git Two-Stage_Neural_Controller_Training`

The Python verifier dependencies are managed by the external Two-Stage / α,β-CROWN repositories;
TorchLean does not try to own that environment. Local α,β-CROWN runs follow those repositories'
instructions. TorchLean's producer-side bridge for leaf artifacts is
`scripts/verification/abcrown/export_leaf_artifact.py`; it converts a raw terminal-domain dump into the
JSON checked by `lake exe verify -- abcrown-leaf`.

# What Is Actually Checked

When the artifact contains enough model and bound data, the Lean pipelines re-evaluate models
against TorchLean's semantics, including the chosen scalar domain such as `IEEE32Exec`, and run
TorchLean's bound propagation and checkers on the resulting graphs. The `abcrown-leaf` JSON
artifacts are structural leaf artifacts today: TorchLean can parse them and check their declared
shape, metadata, box nesting, and exported witness lower-bound test; stronger certificates would
additionally replay or prove the bound computation and, for a whole root-region claim, check leaf
coverage.

For branch-and-bound verification, the theorem pattern is:

$$`B=\bigcup_{\ell=1}^m B_\ell,
\qquad
\forall \ell,\;\operatorname{Safe}(B_\ell)
\quad\Longrightarrow\quad
\operatorname{Safe}(B).`

For neural-controller workflows, the certificate target often has a Lyapunov shape:

$$`V(x)\ge 0,\qquad
\dot V(x)=\nabla V(x)\cdot f(x,u_\theta(x))\le -\alpha\|x\|^2.`

Certificates checked against the shared IR semantics: see the `RealCert`-style artifacts in
*Certificates*.

For the Lean declarations, open the [verification CLI](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Verification/CLI.lean) and the
[α,β-CROWN leaf checker](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Verification/Cert/AbCrownLeafCert.lean). The external producer
checkout is separate, and sample assets are kept in `NN/Examples/Verification/AbCrown/`.

# Reproducibility Notes

Two stage workflows depend on both the Lean checker and the external producer environment. The
short checklist that helps most is to pin the external producer commit, record the Python
environment used for the external verifier, and record the scalar backend selected for the Lean
replay.
That makes it much easier to compare a Lean replay against the original Python run later.
