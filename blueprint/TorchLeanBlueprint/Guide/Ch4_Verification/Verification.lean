Testing asks what a network did on the inputs we tried. Verification asks what it must do on every
input in a set. For a classifier `f`, an input region `X`, the intended class `y`, and a competing
class `j`, a typical robustness target is

$$`\forall x\in X,\qquad f_y(x)-f_j(x)>0.`

That single formula hides most of the engineering. We need to know which model `f` denotes, how
`X` was represented, how the output bounds were obtained, and whether the arithmetic was exact or
rounded. TorchLean therefore keeps apart four objects that are often compressed into the word
"certificate":

1. the exact graph semantics and mathematical property;
2. a bound-propagation theorem over those semantics;
3. an executable checker or imported artifact;
4. a bridge proving that accepted executable evidence satisfies the theorem's hypotheses.

Only their composition yields the final claim. We begin with a complete executable run, then open
it layer by layer.

# A Complete Robustness Run

The bundled robustness workflow constructs a two-output network, compiles it to TorchLean's
canonical IR, places an `L∞` box of radius `0.1` around `[1, 1]`, and computes both IBP and CROWN
bounds:

```
lake exe verify -- torchlean-robustness
```

The relevant part of the output is:

```
compiled IR nodes: 4
x0 = [1.000000, 1.000000], eps = 0.100000
[IBP] logits lo = [1.800000, -2.200000]
[IBP] logits hi = [2.200000, -1.800000]
[IBP] margin(lo0 - hi1) = 3.600000
[IBP] certified? true
[CROWN] margin(lo0 - hi1) = 3.600000
[CROWN] certified? true
[CROWN-backward] margin lo = 3.600000
[CROWN-backward] margin hi = 4.400000
[CROWN-backward] certified? true
```

The interval calculation says that class-zero's logit is at least `1.8`, while class-one's logit is
at most `-1.8`. Consequently,

$$`\inf_{x\in X}(f_0(x)-f_1(x))\ge 1.8-(-1.8)=3.6>0.`

The printed `true` is useful, but it is not itself the theorem. To turn the run into a proof, we
must connect the following statements:

1. the compiled graph denotes the source model;
2. the bound propagation encloses the graph denotation on `X`;
3. the positive lower margin implies the classification property;
4. if the claim concerns native Float32 execution, the native path refines the arithmetic used in
   the proof.

This distinction is practical. If the model compiler changes, obligation 1 is the place to look.
If a new activation is added to CROWN, obligation 2 changes. If the deployment claim concerns
CUDA rather than real semantics, obligation 4 cannot be skipped.

# Semantic Target And Graph Boundary

The verifier operates on the canonical `NN.IR.Graph`. An interval or affine form is meaningful only
relative to a denotation of that same graph, parameter store, and input box. A compiler theorem is
therefore part of a source-model claim.

TorchLean has two relevant forward correspondences:

- The typed first-order
  [proved forward fragment](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Verification/TorchLean/Proved/Public.lean)
  compiles `NN.Verification.TorchLean.Proved.Program` values. Its constructors cover constants,
  parameters, arithmetic, ReLU, `exp`, `log`, inverse, matrix products, reshapes and permutations,
  last-axis softmax, 2D LayerNorm, linear and convolution layers, and MSE loss.
  `compileForward_wellFormed` proves structural well-formedness, while
  `runForwardIR_eq_evalForward` proves equality with the typed program evaluator.
- `execGraphOfIR_semantics_eq` proves that a successful lowering from canonical IR to Lean's
  executable autograd `ExecGraphData` preserves denotation for every input, under `NoMSELoss` and
  `NoRawLog`.

Both are Lean semantic equalities over an abstract scalar `Context`. They are not statements that a
PyTorch module, CUDA kernel, or vendor library agrees with the graph. General API compilation also
does not inherit the typed-fragment theorem merely because it returns the same IR type.

```
#check NN.Verification.TorchLean.Proved.compileForward_wellFormed
#check NN.Verification.TorchLean.Proved.runForwardIR_eq_evalForward
#check NN.Runtime.Autograd.Compiled.IRExec.Correctness.execGraphOfIR_semantics_eq
```

# IBP

Interval bound propagation assigns each node a box. For an affine layer

$$`y=Wx+b,\qquad x\in[\ell,u],`

the usual sign split gives

$$`\ell_y=W^+\ell+W^-u+b,\qquad
u_y=W^+u+W^-\ell+b,`

where `W^+ = max(W,0)` and `W^- = min(W,0)`. Monotone activations transform endpoints; ReLU maps
`[\ell,u]` to `[max(0,\ell),max(0,u)]`. Elementwise multiplication needs all endpoint products.

The generic real soundness theorem is `cert_encloses_semantics`. It requires:

- `TopoSorted g`;
- `Supported g`;
- exact local certificate consistency `CertLocalOK`;
- exact local value consistency `SemLocalOK`;
- `InputsEnclosed`.

It concludes that each available certificate box encloses the matching semantic value. The current
`Supported` predicate contains input, constant, detach, addition, subtraction, elementwise
multiplication, ReLU, linear, matrix multiplication, tanh, sigmoid, sine, and cosine nodes.

The proof-side real evaluator has the stronger end-to-end theorem
`runIBP?_encloses_evalGraphRec`. It proves that the particular real `runIBP?` construction encloses
`evalGraphRec`, under topological order, supported operations, and enclosed inputs. This is a
theorem about those proof-side definitions; it is not automatically a theorem about every
executable `Graph.runIBP` path.

```
#check NN.MLTheory.CROWN.CertSoundness.cert_encloses_semantics
#check NN.MLTheory.CROWN.Proofs.runIBP?_encloses_evalGraphRec
```

## Train, Compile, Then Bound

The robustness command above begins with fixed parameters so the arithmetic is easy to inspect.
The MLP workflow exercises a longer path: train a `2 -> 100 -> 1` model with the compiled backend,
lower the trained model, and run public IBP over a small input box.

```
lake exe verify -- torchlean-mlp-workflow
```

One seeded run prints:

```
== TorchLean MLP workflow (2 → 100 → 1) ==
Training with backend=Runtime.Autograd.Torch.Backend.compiled, device=cpu
dataset size = 3
mean_loss(before) = 4.751697
mean_loss(after) = 0.834089
Checking public IBP bounds on a small input box
IBP nodes=20 output_dim=1 lo=[1.524955] hi=[1.826789]
```

The loss decrease is a runtime observation. The final interval is a bound produced by the public
IBP implementation. A theorem about the trained model additionally needs the exact parameter
store used in compilation and a soundness bridge for this executable bound path. Keeping those
claims separate prevents a successful training log from being mistaken for a robustness proof.

# CROWN, Alpha-CROWN, And Alpha-Beta-CROWN

CROWN propagates affine lower and upper forms rather than only boxes. At an uncertain ReLU with
`l < 0 < u`, the secant upper relaxation is

$$`\operatorname{ReLU}(z)
\le \frac{u}{u-l}(z-l),`

while a lower relaxation may use a slope `alpha` constrained to a valid range. Alpha-CROWN
optimizes these slopes. Alpha-beta-CROWN additionally records branch phases: an active branch uses
`z >= 0`, and an inactive branch uses `z <= 0`.

TorchLean's generic theorem `crown_checker_encloses_semantics` takes an exact
`CrownCertLocalOK` hypothesis and a separate `CrownTransferSound` proof. The local transfer
theorems

- `alphaCrown_transfer_sound`;
- `alphaBetaCrown_transfer_sound`

show that the proposition-level alpha and alpha-beta step functions satisfy
`CrownTransferSound` under their explicit real-semantic and enclosure hypotheses. The alpha-beta
step rejects phase choices inconsistent with the current IBP interval.

```
#check NN.MLTheory.CROWN.CrownSoundness.crown_checker_encloses_semantics
#check NN.MLTheory.CROWN.AlphaCrownTransferSoundness.alphaCrown_transfer_sound
#check NN.MLTheory.CROWN.AlphaCrownTransferSoundness.alphaBetaCrown_transfer_sound
```

These theorems should not be confused with the JSON node-certificate checkers:

- `checkCROWNNodeCertificate`;
- `checkAlphaBetaCROWNNodeCertificate`.

Those `IO Bool` functions parse finite decimal fields into `IEEE32Exec`, recompute the complete IBP
trace from trusted inputs and parameters, and replay affine nodes from previously recomputed affine
data. A serialized interval may be wider than the recomputed interval but may not move inward.
Affine replay data must match exactly at the binary32 level. The alpha-beta checker also validates
branch-vector lengths, entries, and phase consistency.

There is currently no theorem that turns acceptance of either executable checker into
`CrownCertLocalOK`. Checker acceptance is reproducible binary32 replay evidence, not by itself an
instance of `crown_checker_encloses_semantics`.

# From Bounds To A Robustness Claim

Suppose a sound bound procedure produces, for every `x` in the input box,

$$`f_y(x)\ge L_y,\qquad f_j(x)\le U_j.`

Then `L_y-U_j>0` proves the pairwise class margin. A multiclass certificate repeats this for every
`j != y`. The arithmetic is elementary; the substantive obligations are that:

- the bounds enclose the exact graph semantics;
- the graph denotes the intended model;
- the input box denotes the intended perturbation set;
- any rounded or native execution is related to the exact graph.

For a rounded implementation with coordinate errors
`|f_i^run(x)-f_i(x)| <= epsilon_i`, the transferred margin is

$$`f_y^{run}(x)-f_j^{run}(x)
\ge L_y-U_j-\varepsilon_y-\varepsilon_j.`

The right-hand side must remain positive. A real CROWN theorem alone does not prove the native
binary32 claim; the FP32 and runtime-approximation sections describe the additional bridge.

# Executable Certificates And Imported Artifacts

TorchLean currently checks several kinds of artifact, each with a deliberately limited meaning.

The graph numerical certificate records source ranges, derived node ranges, a registry identity,
and a backend-plan audit. `generateChecked` reconstructs this data, and `executeIEEE32` performs a
bit-level reference replay while checking each intermediate tensor. A `GraphRangeContract`
contains an executable `derive` function but no semantic soundness field. A proof-level error trace
therefore also requires a separately constructed `CheckedRealExecution`, whose fields supply the
real denotation and enclosure proof. See the runtime-approximation section for the complete
boundary.

The external alpha-beta-CROWN leaf checker `checkAbCrownLeafArtifact` validates the JSON schema,
finite ordered root and leaf boxes, dimensions, containment of each represented leaf in the root,
and the exported lower-bound witness relative to its threshold. It does not prove that the lower
bound came from the network semantics, and it does not prove that the represented leaves cover the
root box. Those are producer obligations.

This yields three distinct uses of "certificate":

- a Lean term containing proof fields;
- an artifact accepted by a structural or numerical checker;
- an externally produced claim whose semantic validity is assumed.

The certificate chapter runs the leaf checker, changes a witness so that it must fail, and explains
which stronger artifact would be needed to obtain root-region soundness.

# Floating-Point Boundary

The proof float `FP32` is `NF binaryRadix fexp32 rnd32`: a rounded-real model with gradual
underflow. Its exponent description has no upper bound, so it does not model overflow, NaN,
infinity, or signed-zero payload behavior. `IEEE32Exec` is the executable bit-level model.

Finite refinement lemmas such as `toReal_add_eq_fp32Round`, and corresponding multiplication,
division, and square-root bridges, connect individual finite IEEE executions to the proof-level
rounding model. Layer and MLP theorems then propagate explicit error budgets. Neither layer is an
unstated theorem about native hardware or a vendor reduction schedule.

The generic IEEE32 CROWN theorem likewise leaves the node evaluator and
`CrownTransferSound` proof to its caller. Choosing an IEEE scalar type does not discharge the
floating refinement obligations.

# Trust Ledger

A verification report should make the following boundary visible:

| Evidence | Established in current source | Not established by that evidence |
|---|---|---|
| `runForwardIR_eq_evalForward` | typed proved-program and IR evaluator agree | arbitrary frontend or native runtime agreement |
| `runIBP?_encloses_evalGraphRec` | proof-side real IBP encloses proof-side real semantics | every executable IBP implementation |
| `cert_encloses_semantics` | enclosure from exact local IBP and semantic hypotheses | that a JSON/Float checker supplied those hypotheses |
| `alphaCrown_transfer_sound` / `alphaBetaCrown_transfer_sound` | exact real local affine transfer soundness | approximate artifact-checker acceptance |
| CROWN node checker returns `true` | artifact intervals contain the authoritative `IEEE32Exec` IBP trace and affine entries exactly match a sequential `IEEE32Exec` replay | exact-real CROWN soundness |
| alpha-beta leaf checker succeeds | represented boxes and witness fields pass structural/numeric checks | network-bound provenance or root coverage |
| numerical range check plus IEEE replay | stored trace and one reference execution pass executable checks | real semantic enclosure without `CheckedRealExecution` |
| FP32 approximation theorem | rounded-real output is within its stated budget | native IEEE behavior without finite refinement |

The ledger is the practical rule for reading the rest of the chapter: tests catch regressions,
checkers reject malformed evidence, contracts state obligations, and theorems prove propositions.
One does not silently substitute for another.
