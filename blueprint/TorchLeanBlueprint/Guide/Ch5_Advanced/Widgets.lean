#doc (Manual) "Widgets" =>

tag := "widgets"

Widgets are the human inspection layer of TorchLean. They do not define semantics and they do not
prove theorems. They let a reader see the Lean objects that the semantics and theorems are about:
tensors, IR graphs, shape inference results, Float32 bit patterns, CROWN bounds, autograd tapes,
gradients, and training logs.

The [widgets API](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Widgets/) is collected by `NN.Entrypoint.Widgets`. Import that entrypoint
when you want only the widget layer; `import NN` includes it as part of the broad main library
umbrella.

This is the only widget chapter in the guide. It starts with the semantic boundary for widgets,
then gives compact examples, then maps the widget families to the objects they inspect.

Formal artifacts are hard to debug because they are often large, nested, and invisible: graph
nodes, tensor shapes, interval boxes, affine forms, tape cotangents, Float32 bit patterns. Widgets
make those artifacts visible inside the same editor where the theorem or checker lives.

# What Widgets Are For

Widgets are a debugging UI, not a proof system. TorchLean keeps the meaning of "execute this"
explicit:

- Widgets that inspect tensors are read-only formatted views of concrete values (they do not change
  the underlying data).
- Widgets that *run* something (IR evaluation, backprop traces) are running a specific computation defined in Lean
  semantics (for example `NN.IR.Semantics` for the IR with operation tags, or `Runtime.Autograd.Engine` for the
  tape engine).

That matters because it keeps assumptions visible instead of conflating visualization with proof:

- An execution trace widget is an evaluator defined in Lean stepping through the chosen semantics.
- A theorem still requires a proof about the same semantics the widget executes.

The intended workflow is simple: a widget renders a Lean object under a chosen Lean interpretation.
It should not invent a new meaning that the proof and checker layers cannot see.

So a widget can make a proof obligation visible, but it does not replace the proof. If a graph view
shows a bad shape, we fix the graph or the compiler. If a CROWN view shows loose bounds, we improve
the bound pass or certificate. The visualization is a microscope, not an oracle.

| Widget | Object inspected | Main question |
|---|---|---|
| `#tensor_view` | typed tensor | what values and shape? |
| `#ir_view` | `NN.IR.Graph` | what nodes and parents? |
| `#shape_infer_view` | graph shape inference | where is the shape mismatch? |
| `#ir_exec_trace_view` | IR execution | what did each node compute? |
| `#float32_view` | `IEEE32Exec` | what are the bits? |
| `#crown_view` | verifier state | where are the bounds? |
| `#tape_trace_view` | autograd tape | how did gradients flow? |
| `#train_log_view` | training log | did metrics move? |

# IR Graph Viewer

The IR widget family is meant to answer the three debugging questions that show up in practice:

1. *Structure*: which nodes, parents, and shapes are present?
2. *Invariants*: do declared node shapes match what the ops infer from parent shapes?
3. *Semantics*: when the graph is evaluated, which node fails first and what are the intermediate values?

# Verification (IBP/CROWN State)

TorchLean's verification stack includes executable bound propagation engines (IBP and CROWN
affine forms). When debugging a verifier, it is often most useful to inspect which nodes have
bounds and whether shapes and flattened dimensions match the intended layout.

```

# Autograd (Tape + Gradients)

TorchLean's eager autograd engine records a computation graph into a `Tape` and can run
reverse-mode to accumulate gradients. The widget below shows the recorded tape and the gradients
produced by scalar backprop (like `loss.backward()` in PyTorch).

```
open Runtime.Autograd
open Spec

def sampleTape : Tape Float :=
  let (t0, aId) :=
    Tape.leaf (α := Float) (t := Tape.empty)
      (value := Tensor.scalar 2.0) (name := some "a")
  let (t1, bId) :=
    Tape.leaf (α := Float) (t := t0)
      (value := Tensor.scalar 3.0) (name := some "b")
  let (t2, abId) :=
    match Tape.mul (α := Float) (t := t1)
        (s := Shape.scalar) aId bId with
    | .ok r => r
    | .error _ => (t1, 0)
  let (t3, outId) :=
    match Tape.add (α := Float) (t := t2)
        (s := Shape.scalar) abId bId with
    | .ok r => r
    | .error _ => (t2, 0)
  let _ := outId

#tape_trace_view sampleTape, 3
```

# Training Dashboards

TorchLean's widget layer is not limited to semantic objects like tensors and tapes. It also
includes a small monitoring surface for training and evaluation artifacts.

These logs are plain data structures, not a hidden runtime UI:

- `Runtime.Training.TrainLog` is just a pure record of steps, metric series, and notes,
- `Runtime.Training.ConfusionMatrix` is just a pure table of class counts,
- the widget layer renders them without changing their meaning.

That makes them suitable for pure Lean small runs, runtime/autograd training loops, and imported
metrics from external experiments, all rendered through the same viewer.

```
def sampleTrainLog : _root_.Runtime.Training.TrainLog :=
  { title := "Classifier training run"
    steps := #[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    series := #[
      { name := "loss", values := #[1.20, 0.84, 0.59, 0.41, 0.33], color := "#c44" }
    , { name := "val_acc", values := #[0.30, 0.48, 0.61, 0.73, 0.79], color := "#0a7" }
    , { name := "lr", values := #[0.05, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], color := "#06c" }
    ]
    notes := #[
      "optimizer: SGD"
    , "scheduler: StepLR(step_size=2, gamma=0.2)"
    , "dataset: synthetic 3-class classifier"
    ] }

def sampleLabels : Array String := #["cat", "dog", "owl"]

def sampleCM : _root_.Runtime.Training.ConfusionMatrix :=
  { counts := #[
      #[8, 1, 0]
    , #[2, 6, 1]
    , #[0, 1, 7]
    ] }

#train_log_view sampleTrainLog
#confusion_view sampleLabels, sampleCM
```

This widget family pairs particularly well with:

- the CSV loader training example,
- the NPY loader training example,
- the ResNet basic block training example,
- and the callback/reporting helpers under `API.train`.

# Runtime Context Viewer

When debugging a failed training step, one of the first questions is often not "what is the graph?"
but "which values and gradients are registered now?"

The runtime-context widget answers that question directly.

```
def anyScalar (x : Float) : Runtime.AnyTensor Float :=
  { s := .scalar, t := Tensor.scalar x }

def sampleCtx : Runtime.RuntimeContext Float :=
  { var_registry := [
      ("w", anyScalar 3.0)
    , ("x", anyScalar 2.0)
    , ("wx", anyScalar 6.0)
    ]
    gradients := [
      ("w", anyScalar 2.0)
    , ("x", anyScalar 3.0)
    ]
    next_id := 3 }

#runtime_ctx_view sampleCtx
```

This view is especially useful for comparing:

- the public training API,
- the eager autograd tape,
- and the actual runtime registry that stores values and accumulated gradients.
