A two-layer perceptron is enough to introduce typed tensors and reverse-mode differentiation. It is
not enough to test whether an ML library has found the right abstractions. Modern architectures add
branches, state, masks, patch grids, spectral transforms, latent variables, and interaction with an
environment. Each addition creates a new place where an informal convention can become a bug.

TorchLean therefore treats the model examples as applications of the same small set of ideas:

1. an architecture has a typed input and output shape;
2. its parameters have an explicit ordered layout;
3. its forward program runs through a selected runtime;
4. mathematical specifications and proofs refer to named objects, not to an opaque training log;
5. an external kernel, dataset, or environment remains visible at the boundary where it enters.

The public constructors live under
[`NN/API/Models`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/API/Models).
The runnable applications live under
[`NN/Examples/Models`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Examples/Models).
That distinction matters. A constructor such as `nn.models.resnet` is reusable and
rank-polymorphic; the `resnet` command chooses a deliberately small CIFAR configuration so that a
reader can run the whole data and training path locally.

# From A Formula To A Typed Model

Consider an ordinary one-hidden-layer network

$$`f_\theta(x)=W_2\,\rho(W_1x+b_1)+b_2.`

For a batch of `B` vectors, the shapes are

$$`X\in\mathbb{R}^{B\times d_{\mathrm{in}}},\qquad
W_1\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\mathrm{in}}\times d_h},\qquad
W_2\in\mathbb{R}^{d_h\times d_{\mathrm{out}}}.`

The TorchLean constructor records the outer contract as

```
nn.Sequential
  (shape![batch, inDim])
  (shape![batch, outDim])
```

and composes layers only when their intermediate shapes agree. The runtime still performs ordinary
matrix multiplication, bias addition, and activation evaluation. The type checker removes one
class of invalid programs before that runtime is reached.

The same pattern survives when the architecture becomes less linear. What changes is the shape
equation that must be made explicit.

# Residual Networks

A residual block computes

$$`y=F_\theta(x)+S_\theta(x),`

where `S` is either the identity or a projection. The addition is defined only if the two branches
have the same output shape. In
[`NN.API.Models.ResNet`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/API/Models/ResNet.lean),
the reusable configuration is indexed by the number `d` of spatial axes:

```
structure ResNetConfig (d : Nat) where
  batch          : Nat
  inChannels     : Nat
  spatial        : Vector Nat d
  spatialNonzero : ∀ i, spatial.get i ≠ 0
  hiddenChannels : Nat
  numClasses     : Nat
```

Its input and output are

$$`\operatorname{input}
=B\times C_{\mathrm{in}}\times n_1\times\cdots\times n_d,`

$$`\operatorname{output}=B\times C_{\mathrm{class}}.`

The constructor uses a convolutional stem, two residual blocks, global average pooling over all
`d` spatial axes, and a linear classifier. The pooling operation is parameterized by the spatial
vector. The CIFAR example instantiates `d=2`; the model API itself is not tied to images or to two
dimensions.

Run the compact application after preparing CIFAR:

```
python3 scripts/datasets/download_example_data.py --cifar10
lake exe torchlean resnet --device cpu --n-total 1 --steps 1
```

On the current checkout with seed `0`, the final lines are:

```
dataset size = 1
mean_loss(before) = 2.333221
mean_loss(after) = 2.327496
steps=1 loss0=2.333221 loss1=2.327496
torchlean resnet: ok
```

This is a one-update integration run, not a CIFAR accuracy result. It confirms that the prepared
array, typed residual model, cross-entropy objective, autograd tape, optimizer, and CPU runtime
worked together.

## Try A Shape Change

Open
[`NN/Examples/Models/Vision/ResNet.lean`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/Models/Vision/ResNet.lean)
and inspect `cfg`. The command uses an `8 × 8` crop and four hidden channels. Changing the hidden
width changes both residual branches and the classifier input. Removing the projection that keeps
the branch shapes aligned is not a late runtime error: the residual composition no longer
elaborates.

# Vision Transformers

A vision Transformer first turns a spatial field into a token sequence. For an input with spatial
extent `n₁ × ... × n_d`, patch kernel `k`, stride `s`, and padding `p`, each output extent is the
usual convolution expression

$$`n'_i
=\left\lfloor\frac{n_i+2p_i-k_i}{s_i}\right\rfloor+1.`

If the patch convolution emits `D` channels, then the patch grid becomes

$$`B\times D\times n'_1\times\cdots\times n'_d
\;\longrightarrow\;
B\times N\times D,\qquad
N=\prod_i n'_i.`

[`NN.API.Models.Vit`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/API/Models/Vit.lean)
defines this conversion as `spatialToTokens`. The implementation reshapes the patch grid and moves
the channel axis to the end. The following Transformer block therefore receives the conventional
`batch × sequence × embedding` layout.

For `H` attention heads of width `D_h`, the model width is

$$`D=H D_h,`

and scaled dot-product attention is

$$`\operatorname{Attention}(Q,K,V)
=\operatorname{softmax}\!\left(\frac{QK^\top}{\sqrt{D_h}}+M\right)V.`

The current ViT application uses one encoder block and flattens all patch tokens before the final
classifier. It is a compact architecture check, not an implementation of a particular pretrained
ViT checkpoint.

```
lake exe torchlean vit --device cpu --n-total 1 --steps 1
```

The observed one-example run begins at the uniform ten-class loss:

```
mean_loss(before) = 2.302585
mean_loss(after) = 2.300389
```

The value `2.302585` is `log 10` to the displayed precision. That is a useful sanity check: before
the first update, the model is effectively assigning equal probability to ten classes.

# Recurrence, Attention, And Causality

Sequence models add state or a causal dependency.

For a vanilla recurrent network,

$$`h_{t+1}=\phi(W_xx_t+W_hh_t+b),\qquad
y_t=W_yh_t+b_y.`

An LSTM replaces the single update by input, forget, output, and candidate gates:

$$`\begin{aligned}
i_t&=\sigma(W_ix_t+U_ih_{t-1}+b_i),\\
f_t&=\sigma(W_fx_t+U_fh_{t-1}+b_f),\\
o_t&=\sigma(W_ox_t+U_oh_{t-1}+b_o),\\
\tilde c_t&=\tanh(W_cx_t+U_ch_{t-1}+b_c),\\
c_t&=f_t\odot c_{t-1}+i_t\odot\tilde c_t,\\
h_t&=o_t\odot\tanh(c_t).
\end{aligned}`

The hidden and cell states are explicit tensors whose dimensions must remain stable across the
unrolled sequence. The runnable `rnn`, `lstm`, and `lstm_regression` commands use that typed state
path. There is currently no GRU training subcommand. The LiRPA verifier has a GRU-gate certificate
fixture, but that is a different artifact and should not be presented as a trainable GRU model.

Transformers remove recurrent state but introduce a mask. A causal language model factors

$$`p_\theta(x_0,\ldots,x_T)
=\prod_{t=0}^{T}p_\theta(x_t\mid x_0,\ldots,x_{t-1}).`

Consequently, attention row `i` must assign exactly zero probability to every key `j>i`. TorchLean
models this as a hard mask in the semantic layer. It does not use a finite additive constant such
as `-1000` as a mathematical substitute for negative infinity.

The shared GPT-family constructor in
[`NN.API.Models.Gpt2`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/API/Models/Gpt2.lean)
has the architecture

```
token embedding
  -> learned positional embedding
  -> masked Transformer blocks
  -> layer normalization
  -> vocabulary projection
```

Its configuration records batch size, sequence length, vocabulary size, head count, head width,
feed-forward width, depth, activation, dropout, normalization order, and initialization. The name
“GPT-2-style” describes this architecture lineage. It does not mean that the command loads OpenAI
GPT-2 weights.

# State-Space Models

Mamba-style models return to explicit state but allow input-dependent scan parameters. A simplified
state-space recurrence is

$$`h_{t+1}=A_t h_t+B_t x_t,\qquad
y_t=C_t h_t+D_t x_t.`

[`NN.API.Models.Mamba`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/API/Models/Mamba.lean)
contains two related objects:

- `mambaTextLm`, the trainable recurrent model used by the text command;
- `selectiveMambaFloat`, a deterministic full selective block used for reference evaluation.

The trainable path uses TorchLean autograd operations on CPU or CUDA. The repository also has a
selective-scan CUDA operation for supported float execution. That runtime kernel is not thereby
proved equivalent to every equation in the high-level Mamba specification; the kernel boundary is
reported separately.

# Neural Operators

An FNO learns a map between functions sampled on a grid rather than a map between fixed feature
vectors. One spectral block has the schematic form

$$`v_{\ell+1}(x)
=\sigma\!\left(W_\ell v_\ell(x)
+\mathcal F^{-1}\!\left(R_\ell\cdot\mathcal F(v_\ell)\right)(x)\right).`

The configuration in
[`NN.API.Models.FNO`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/API/Models/FNO.lean)
is again parameterized by spatial rank. For every axis it requires

$$`2m_i\le n_i,`

so the retained low- and high-frequency bands do not overlap. The portable implementation uses a
dense multidimensional DFT. The CUDA Burgers application selects a fused real-FFT path backed by
cuFFT. Both paths implement the same typed field-to-field interface, but their numerical and trust
boundaries are recorded separately.

# Run Them End To End

We have now seen how the model families are assembled. The next chapter takes three of them off the
page: a character Transformer, a residual vision model, and a Fourier neural operator. It prepares
their data, launches training, and inspects the artifacts they leave behind.
