Widgets are the human inspection layer of TorchLean. They do not define semantics and they do not
prove theorems. They let a reader see the Lean objects that the semantics and theorems are about:
tensors, IR graphs, shape inference results, Float32 bit patterns, CROWN bounds, autograd tapes,
gradients, and training logs.

The [widgets source](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/tree/main/NN/Widgets/) is collected by `NN.Widgets`. Import that module
when you want only the widget layer; `import NN` includes it as part of the broad main library
umbrella.

Formal artifacts are hard to debug because they are often large, nested, and invisible: graph
nodes, tensor shapes, interval boxes, affine forms, tape cotangents, Float32 bit patterns. Widgets
make those artifacts visible inside the same editor where the theorem or checker lives.

# IR Graph Viewer

The IR widget family answers the three debugging questions that show up in practice:

1. *Structure*: which nodes, parents, and shapes are present?
2. *Invariants*: do declared node shapes match what the ops infer from parent shapes?
3. *Semantics*: when the graph is evaluated, which node fails first and what are the intermediate values?

```

# Verification (IBP/CROWN State)

TorchLean's verification code includes executable bound propagation engines: IBP boxes and
CROWN affine forms. When debugging a verifier, inspect which nodes
have bounds and whether shapes and flattened dimensions match the intended layout.

# Autograd (Tape + Gradients)

TorchLean's eager autograd engine records a computation graph into a `Tape` and can run
reverse-mode to accumulate gradients. The widget below shows the recorded tape and the gradients
produced by scalar backprop (like `loss.backward()` in PyTorch).

```
open Runtime.Autograd
open Spec

def sampleTape : Tape Float :=
  let (t0, aId) :=
    Tape.leaf (α := Float) (t := Tape.empty)
      (value := Tensor.scalar 2.0) (name := some "a")
  let (t1, bId) :=
    Tape.leaf (α := Float) (t := t0)
      (value := Tensor.scalar 3.0) (name := some "b")
  let (t2, abId) :=
    match Tape.mul (α := Float) (t := t1)
        (s := Shape.scalar) aId bId with
    | .ok r => r
    | .error _ => (t1, 0)
  let (t3, outId) :=
    match Tape.add (α := Float) (t := t2)
        (s := Shape.scalar) abId bId with
    | .ok r => r
    | .error _ => (t2, 0)
  let _ := outId
  t3

```

# Training Dashboards

TorchLean's widget layer is not limited to semantic objects like tensors and tapes. It also
includes a small monitoring API for training and evaluation artifacts.

These logs are plain data structures, not a hidden runtime UI:

- `Runtime.Training.TrainLog` is a pure record of steps, metric series, and notes,
- `Runtime.Training.ConfusionMatrix` is a pure table of class counts,
- the widget layer renders them without changing their meaning.

That makes them suitable for pure Lean small runs, runtime/autograd training loops, and imported
metrics from external experiments, all rendered through the same viewer.

```
def sampleTrainLog : _root_.Runtime.Training.TrainLog :=
  { title := "Classifier training run"
    steps := #[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    series := #[
      { name := "loss", values := #[1.20, 0.84, 0.59, 0.41, 0.33], color := "#c44" }
    , { name := "val_acc", values := #[0.30, 0.48, 0.61, 0.73, 0.79], color := "#0a7" }
    , { name := "lr", values := #[0.05, 0.05, 0.01, 0.01, 0.01], color := "#06c" }
    ]
    notes := #[
      "optimizer: SGD"
    , "scheduler: StepLR(step_size=2, gamma=0.2)"
    , "dataset: synthetic 3-class classifier"
    ] }

def sampleLabels : Array String := #["cat", "dog", "owl"]

def sampleCM : _root_.Runtime.Training.ConfusionMatrix :=
  { counts := #[
      #[8, 1, 0]
    , #[2, 6, 1]
    , #[0, 1, 7]
    ] }

#train_log_view sampleTrainLog
#confusion_view sampleLabels, sampleCM
```

This widget family pairs particularly well with:

- the CSV loader training example,
- the NPY loader training example,
- the CNN and ViT model commands,
- and the callback/reporting helpers exposed through `Trainer` reports.

# Runtime Context Viewer

When debugging a failed training step, one of the first questions is often not "what is the graph?"
but "which values and gradients are registered now?"

The runtime-context widget answers that question directly.

```
def anyScalar (x : Float) : Runtime.AnyTensor Float :=
  { s := .scalar, t := Tensor.scalar x }

def sampleCtx : Runtime.RuntimeContext Float :=
  { var_registry := [
      ("w", anyScalar 3.0)
    , ("x", anyScalar 2.0)
    , ("wx", anyScalar 6.0)
    ]
    gradients := [
      ("w", anyScalar 2.0)
    , ("x", anyScalar 3.0)
    ]
    next_id := 3 }

#runtime_ctx_view sampleCtx
```

This view is good for comparing:

- the public training API,
- the eager autograd tape,
- and the actual runtime registry that stores values and accumulated gradients.

# GPT And Text-Model Logs

GPT-style examples write normal `TrainLog` artifacts, but prompt/sample notes benefit from a
specialized renderer:

```
#gpt2_train_log_file_view "data/model_zoo/gpt2_trainlog.json"
#gpt2_prompt_view "ROMEO:"
```

The file view is the one to use in documentation because it renders an artifact that already exists.
The prompt view can run a small command from the editor, which is convenient for demos but should be
described as execution, not passive inspection.

# RL Boundary And Policy Views

RL widgets are about the part of training that scalar reward curves hide:

- the checked transition boundary for Gymnasium rollouts,
- GridWorld policies and paths,
- PPO rollout curves derived from reward/value/advantage data.

The main entry files are:

- [GridWorld widget source](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Widgets/RL/GridWorld.lean)
- [PPO widget source](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Widgets/RL/PPO.lean)
- [RL boundary widget source](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Widgets/RL/Boundary.lean)

Use them when the question is "what exactly entered the learner?" or "what policy/path artifact did
the command write?" Use the proof layer when the question is a theorem about the MDP or boundary.

# PyTorch Translator Widget

The PyTorch translator widget is an editor aid, not the checked importer:

```
#pytorch_translate_file "NN/Examples/Quickstart/pytorch_translator_mlp.py"
```

It helps readers see how a simple `torch.nn` snippet maps onto TorchLean constructors. Checked
interop claims should cite the explicit PyTorch roundtrip/export examples and the artifact bridge,
not the heuristic widget alone.
