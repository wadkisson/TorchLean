The diffusion example in `NN.Examples.Models.Generative.Diffusion` keeps the model definition,
training loop, sampler, and specification-level diffusion definitions in Lean.

The walkthrough runs from data to image artifact: where the pixels come from, how noising is
represented, what the denoiser predicts, and what gets saved after a run.

## Run It First

For a short runtime check, use the CUDA path with a tiny model:

```bash
lake exe -K cuda=true torchlean diffusion --cuda --dataset cifar10 --n-total 1 --steps 1 --hidden-c 1 --T 2
```

For a more informative local run, use CUDA if available. The command writes a JSON loss log and a PPM
image artifact for inspecting both numbers and pixels:

```bash
python3 scripts/datasets/download_example_data.py --cifar10

lake exe -K cuda=true torchlean diffusion --cuda --fast-kernels \
  --dataset cifar10 --n-total 800 --steps 50 --hidden-c 8 \
  --log data/model_zoo/diffusion_trainlog.json \
  --sample-ppm data/model_zoo/diffusion_sample.ppm
```

The command is small enough to run locally, but it still exercises the full path: data conversion,
typed tensors, runtime model, sampler, and saved artifacts.

## Data: Where Images Come From

TorchLean does not decode JPEG/PNG inside Lean. Image decoding and resizing happen before Lean; the
Lean side receives fixed-layout `.npy` tensors and checks their shapes.

Once the arrays exist, the Lean side loads `NCHW` tensors, checks the shape and class range, and
batches them.

The two dataset modes in `NN.Examples.Models.Generative.Diffusion` are:

- CIFAR-10 as `(N, 3, 32, 32)` arrays.
- ImageNet-style folders converted to `(N, 3, 64, 64)` arrays (Imagenette, Tiny-ImageNet, or any
  folder with class subdirectories).

Inside the example, the loader path is straightforward:

1. Build a labeled source over `.npy` files.
2. Load it into a dataset.
3. Create a shuffled batch loader.
4. Map pixel values from `[0, 1]` into the diffusion range `[-1, 1]`.

That last step is a single line in the example code:

```lean
def toDiffusionRange (unitImage : Tensor Float (cleanImageShape c h w)) :
    Tensor Float (cleanImageShape c h w) :=
  Spec.Tensor.mapSpec (fun x => 2.0 * x - 1.0) unitImage
```

## The Spec Layer: What We Mean By “Diffusion”

TorchLean keeps diffusion vocabulary in `NN.Spec.Generative.Diffusion.*`, so training code, sampler
code, and proof modules talk about the same objects.

The DDPM picture is simple enough to state before the formulas: add noise to an image at timestep
`t`, train a model to predict the noise that was added, then run reverse steps that use the model’s
noise prediction to move back toward a clean image. TorchLean gives each component a named
definition so the runtime command and proof modules use the same vocabulary.

At the center is an interface for an epsilon-prediction denoiser:

```lean
structure EpsModel (α : Type) (s : Shape) [Context α] where
  eps : Tensor α s → α → Tensor α s
```

The forward noising process is the standard DDPM formula, but written as a total tensor definition:

```lean
def qSample (sched : VPSchedule α T)
    (x0 : Tensor α s) (t : Fin (T + 1)) (eps : Tensor α s) :
    Tensor α s :=
  let αbar : α := sched.alphaBar t
  let c0 : α := sqrtNonneg αbar
  let c1 : α := sqrtNonneg (1 - αbar)
  Tensor.scaleSpec x0 c0 + Tensor.scaleSpec eps c1
```

The training objective is also named at the spec level:

```lean
def epsPredLoss (sched : VPSchedule α T) (model : EpsModel α s)
    (x0 : Tensor α s) (t : Fin (T + 1)) (eps : Tensor α s) : α :=
  let x_t := qSample sched x0 t eps
  let tScalar : α := VPSchedule.timeOfIndex (α := α) (T := T) t
  let epsHat := model.eps x_t tScalar
  Spec.mseSpec epsHat eps
```

Then the surrounding spec modules define:

- a discrete VP schedule `VPSchedule` with `β_t`, `α_t = 1-β_t`, and cumulative products `ᾱ_t`;
- two reverse samplers:

  - DDPM: a stochastic reverse step with explicit per-step noise inputs,
  - DDIM (η = 0): a deterministic reverse step that reuses the same denoiser but drops the noise.

There are also “hooks” that let diffusion samplers plug into the generic dynamical-system API. For
example, the DDIM spec exposes `ddimStepSystem` and proves the step definition by `rfl` so other
theory can rewrite it safely.

## The Runtime Layer: The Model That Runs

The runnable diffusion command does not work directly with `EpsModel`. It instantiates a concrete
neural network and then uses the public data API to build training samples.

Two choices matter in the example:

1. The epsilon predictor is a residual CNN that preserves resolution
   (`epsResidualConvNet`). The training, sampling, and visualization path stays easy to run
   on a local checkout.
2. Time is fed to the model as an extra channel: the input has `(data channels + 1)` channels,
   where the last channel is the normalized timestep broadcast across spatial positions.

That “append time as a channel” trick is defined once in the API:

```lean
def appendTimeChannel {batch c h w : Nat}
    (x : Spec.Tensor Float (NN.Tensor.Shape.NCHW batch c h w)) (tNorm : Float) :
    Spec.Tensor Float (NN.Tensor.Shape.NCHW batch (c + 1) h w) := ...
```

The model is a same-resolution residual CNN sized to run as an example. The excerpt below is
compressed; the source file expands each convolution with the exact tensor shapes and seeded
initializers:

```lean
def epsResidualConvNet (cfg : EpsConvNetConfig) :
    nn.M (nn.Sequential (epsConvNetInShape cfg) (epsConvNetOutShape cfg)) :=
  nn.sequential![
    conv3x3SameImages,
    nn.relu,
    residualBlock,
    nn.relu,
    residualBlock,
    nn.relu,
    conv3x3SameImages
  ]
```

The tutorial contract is precise: input is noisy `NCHW` image plus time channel, output is predicted
noise with the original image shape.

## Training: What Gets Optimized

Training is classic DDPM-style ε-prediction. Each step:

1. pick a real image batch `x0`,
2. pick a timestep `t`,
3. sample noise `ε`,
4. build a supervised pair `(appendTimeChannel x_t tNorm, ε)`,
5. take an optimizer step on MSE.

TorchLean makes the supervised pair explicit as a `SupervisedSample` value. The operation that
constructs `x_t` from `x0` and `ε` is `NN.API.diffusion.noisedSampleFromEps`; it is the runtime
version of the same formula used by `qSample` in the spec layer.

The excerpt below leaves out the local definitions of `sqrtAb`, `sqrtOneMinusAb`, and `tNorm`, but
keeps the actual tensor transformation:

```lean
def noisedSampleFromEps
    (alphaBars : Array Float) (T : Nat)
    (x0 eps : Tensor Float (NN.Tensor.Shape.NCHW batch c h w)) (step : Nat) :
    SupervisedSample Float
      (NN.Tensor.Shape.NCHW batch (c + 1) h w)
      (NN.Tensor.Shape.NCHW batch c h w) :=
  let x_t :=
    Spec.Tensor.scaleSpec x0 sqrtAb +
    Spec.Tensor.scaleSpec eps sqrtOneMinusAb
  Sample.mk (appendTimeChannel x_t tNorm) eps
```

## Sampling: DDIM Replay In Lean

The example uses deterministic DDIM because it is easy to audit and stable at small scale.

The reverse update used by the runnable example is `NN.API.diffusion.ddimPrev`. It does the usual
“predict x0, clip, remix” step:

- estimate `x0_hat` from `x_t` and `ε̂`,
- clamp it to `[-1, 1]`,
- recombine it using the previous schedule coefficients.

The implementation follows that recipe. Here is the compact form, with the schedule coefficients
shown by name:

```lean
def ddimPrev
    (abPrev ab : Float)
    (x_t epsHat : Tensor Float (NN.Tensor.Shape.NCHW batch c h w)) :
    Tensor Float (NN.Tensor.Shape.NCHW batch c h w) :=
  let x0Hat :=
    Spec.Tensor.scaleSpec
      (Spec.Tensor.subSpec x_t (Spec.Tensor.scaleSpec epsHat sqrtOneMinusAb))
      (1.0 / (if sqrtAb > 1e-12 then sqrtAb else 1e-12))
  let x0Clipped := Spec.Tensor.clampSpec x0Hat (-1.0) 1.0
  Spec.Tensor.scaleSpec x0Clipped sqrtAbPrev +
    Spec.Tensor.scaleSpec epsHat sqrtOneMinusAbPrev
```

The sampler also produces the “three pictures” view:

- a reference image (real `x0`),
- a noisy image at a chosen timestep,
- a reconstruction from DDIM reverse steps starting at that timestep.

## What To Look At After A Run

Diffusion runs are easy to misread from terminal loss alone, so the example pushes you toward
artifacts: images on disk and a JSON curve log. Those files give you something concrete to compare across
CPU/CUDA, fast-kernel switches, schedule tweaks, or model width changes.

For interactive inspection, open `NN.Examples.Models.Generative.Diffusion` in VS Code with the Lean
Infoview enabled. The widgets can display tensor summaries, graph and shape views, and saved JSON
logs next to the source.
