title: Numerical Runtime Certificates
usemathjax: true
---

TorchLean can follow a model through two numerical views. The canonical IR records the operations
that will run. The runtime-approximation graph records the local forward and reverse theorems used
to compare rounded execution with exact real semantics. Both are assembled from operation-level
contracts, so neither checker needs a separate case for an MLP, transformer, convolutional model,
or neural operator.

This page runs the canonical-IR path on a two-layer MLP and then explains where the backward and
optimizer theorems attach.

## Run the Example

From the TorchLean repository:

```bash
lake exe torchlean numerical_certificate
```

The final two rows should be:

```text
  ok  two-layer MLP certificate
  ok  two-layer MLP IEEE replay
```

The same file also runs negative checks. It corrupts a range, registers a duplicate contract,
changes the registry identity, violates the square-root domain, and asks a CUDA capsule with an
implementation-defined reduction order to satisfy a fixed-left reduction certificate. Each case is
rejected.

## The Model

The complete model pass is:

```text
input [1,2]
  -> matmul [2,3]
  -> add bias [1,3]
  -> ReLU
  -> matmul [3,1]
  -> add bias [1,1]
```

Weights and biases are ordinary constant nodes. The checker is not given an `MLP` tag. It sees ten
IR nodes: input, constants, matrix multiplications, additions, and ReLU. This is why the same path
works for a larger architecture assembled from supported operations.

The source is
[`GraphNumericalCertificate.lean`](https://github.com/lean-dojo/TorchLean/blob/main/NN/Examples/DeepDives/Floats/GraphNumericalCertificate.lean).
The definitions `mlpGraph`, `mlpSources`, `mlpPayload`, `mlpCertificate`, and `mlpReplay` are the
complete runnable path.

## What Happens During the Run

### 1. Check operation coverage

`GraphRangeRegistry` maps an operation key to its numerical transfer. Before propagation starts,
TorchLean checks that every node has a registered transfer. An unknown primitive reports its node id
and operation name. It never receives a placeholder interval.

### 2. Propagate source ranges

The example supplies binary32 enclosures for the input and each parameter tensor. Matrix
multiplication uses outward-rounded products and a declared accumulation order. Addition uses
directed endpoints. ReLU restores the nonnegative lower bound of the hidden activation.

The resulting range trace contains one row for every node. A row records the node id, operation,
input enclosures, and derived output enclosure.

### 3. Select backend capsules

The backend planner independently selects a capsule for each operation. A capsule records the
provider, device, layout requirements, forward and VJP ownership, reduction policy, and trust
classification. The example uses the checked portable CPU profile because its fixed-left matrix
accumulation matches the canonical tensor semantics.

Changing the profile is not cosmetic. If a selected provider advertises a different numerical
policy, certificate generation fails until that provider has a matching contract.

### 4. Bind the artifact

`generateChecked` stores the graph, range-registry name, source assumptions, derived ranges, and
backend audit together. Replay checks all of them. Replacing the graph, registry, or backend plan
therefore invalidates the artifact.

### 5. Execute binary32 and replay every node

`executeIEEE32` evaluates the stored graph with TorchLean's bit-level binary32 semantics. Every
intermediate tensor must remain finite and lie in the enclosure regenerated for its node. The run
rejects NaN, infinity, malformed payloads, missing constants, and out-of-range intermediates.

A successful replay means that this concrete binary32 execution passed the stored graph
certificate. It does not, by itself, turn an interval endpoint calculation into a theorem about
every real input. For that statement, pair the checked replay with `CheckedRealExecution`, which
supplies the exact-real inclusion theorem for the same graph and source region.

## Forward, Backward, and the Optimizer

The proof-bearing training path uses `RevGraph`. Each node carries:

- exact and rounded forward functions;
- exact and rounded VJPs;
- a forward error transformer and proof;
- a VJP error transformer and proof.

`RevGraph.eval_approx` composes the forward bounds. `RevGraph.backprop_approx` traverses the same
graph in reverse and includes rounding from gradient accumulation. A parameter gradient can then be
passed to any `NumericalStepContract`:

```lean
#check Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NFBackend.eval_approx_graphData
#check Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NFBackend.backprop_approx_graphData
#check Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NFBackend.backprop_optimizer_update_approx_graphData
#check Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NFBackend.trainingStepTrace
```

SGD, momentum SGD, and AdamW use that one optimizer interface. AdamW contributes additional
step data because square root, bias correction, and division need explicit positivity margins.
`trainingStepTrace` returns forward bounds, backward bounds, the selected parameter-gradient bound,
the next parameter bound, and optimizer-state bounds. A future InfoView or training dashboard can
render this record without changing the proof.

There is one boundary to keep clear. The canonical `NN.IR.Graph` compiler currently proves forward
semantic preservation. It does not yet lower every compiled node to a proof-bearing VJP. Therefore:

- the runnable MLP above is a complete canonical-IR **forward** certificate and IEEE replay;
- rounded backward and optimizer theorems are complete for a supplied proof-bearing `RevGraph`;
- automatically producing that `RevGraph` from every canonical-IR model remains a separate compiler
  theorem.

TorchLean keeps these statements separate so a forward artifact is never presented as a proof of a
backward implementation.

## Adding Another Architecture

No architecture wrapper is required. Lower the model to the canonical graph and check coverage:

```lean
let registry <- Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NumericalCertificate.defaultRegistry
let _ <- Proofs.RuntimeApprox.NumericalCertificate.requireNumericalCoverage registry graph
```

If all primitives are covered, certificate generation and replay work unchanged. If one operation
is missing, add its executable `GraphRangeContract` and prove the corresponding exact-real
enclosure rule. The former extends range generation; the latter is needed before the generated
range can support `CheckedRealExecution`. If execution needs a new provider, add a `KernelCapsule`
and place it in a `CapsuleModule`. The registry and planner then make that implementation available
to every architecture that uses the operation.

The design scales by operations, not by model names.
