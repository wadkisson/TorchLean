title: Verification Bounds

Verification starts with a concrete promise: a property is checked against the graph, parameters,
shapes, and scalar interpretation that the verifier actually saw. TorchLean’s examples make those
objects explicit. Some examples run bound propagation natively over a TorchLean graph. Others replay
an exported certificate. In both cases, the important trail is the artifact being checked and the
predicate Lean recomputes.

## The Question

Most neural-network verification examples begin with a robustness question:

> For every input inside a small box around the example point, can the model’s output still satisfy the
> desired margin or safety condition?

TorchLean represents that question with four concrete objects:

- a model, written in the same API used for training examples;
- a compiled `NN.IR.Graph`, so verifier code can traverse named nodes;
- an input box, with lower and upper bounds for every input coordinate;
- an output property, usually a margin such as `logit_true - logit_other ≥ 0`.

The common path is therefore:

1. write or import a TorchLean model,
2. compile it to `NN.IR.Graph`,
3. attach an input box,
4. run a bound engine,
5. inspect or check the output bounds.

The examples under `NN/Examples/Verification/TorchLean/` keep the model, input box, bound pass, and
reported margin in one place, so the verification path can be read directly from the source.

The local example is compact enough that the whole verification object can be read directly: the
graph, the input box, the output property, and the bound pass all appear in one place. That matters
more than the size of the network. Once the objects are named clearly, the same pattern can be used
for generated graphs, imported weights, or external verifier leaves.

The seed box is built explicitly. For the small MLP example, `inputCenter` is the center point,
`eps` is the radius, and `inputBox` is the flattened input box inserted at the compiled input node:

```lean
let inputCenter : Tensor α xShape :=
  NN.Tensor.tensorNDOfLenEq (α := α) [2] [cast 0.5, cast 0.8] (by rfl)
let eps : α := Runtime.ofFloat 0.1
let rad : Tensor α xShape := Spec.fill eps xShape

let inputBox : FlatBox α :=
  { dim := inDim
    lo := Tensor.subSpec inputCenter rad
    hi := Tensor.addSpec inputCenter rad }

let ps : ParamStore α :=
  { compiled.ps with inputBoxes := compiled.ps.inputBoxes.insert compiled.inputId inputBox }
```

So the verifier is not checking one input point. It is checking all inputs in the box
`[inputCenter - eps, inputCenter + eps]`.

```lean
let ibp := runIBP (α := α) compiled.graph ps
let some outB := ibp[compiled.outputId]! |
  throw <| IO.userError "IBP produced no output box"
```

The bound engine returns node-indexed `FlatBox` values. Each box stores a flattened dimension plus
lower and upper tensors. If the output box satisfies a margin condition such as
`lo[label] > max hi[other]`, every input in the seed box is certified for that label.

## IBP: Propagate Boxes Through The Graph

Interval bound propagation is the simplest sound bound engine used here. Each node gets a lower and
upper bound. The transformer for each operation must enclose all possible outputs of that operation
when its inputs range over their current boxes.

A scalar example captures the idea. Suppose

```text
x ∈ [-1, 2]
y = 3 * x + 0.5
```

IBP computes

```text
y ∈ [3 * (-1) + 0.5, 3 * 2 + 0.5] = [-2.5, 6.5]
```

For a ReLU node, the transformer is monotone:

```text
z ∈ [l, u]
relu(z) ∈ [max(0, l), max(0, u)]
```

For a linear layer, the implementation splits positive and negative weights so each input interval
is used in the direction that gives the worst case. The result is conservative by design: every true
activation is inside the box, but the box may include values that cannot occur together.

That tradeoff explains both why IBP works well as a first verifier and why it can fail to certify
true properties. It is fast, local, and easy to compose over graphs; it loses correlations between
coordinates.

## A Margin Example

Consider a two-logit classifier. To certify class `0` against class `1`, we want:

```text
logit_0 - logit_1 ≥ 0
```

If IBP gives

```text
logit_0 ∈ [1.2, 1.8]
logit_1 ∈ [0.1, 0.7]
```

then the margin is at least `1.2 - 0.7 = 0.5`, so the box certifies the property. If instead IBP
gives

```text
logit_0 ∈ [0.8, 1.4]
logit_1 ∈ [0.2, 1.0]
```

then the lower margin bound is `0.8 - 1.0 = -0.2`. The property is undecided at the IBP-box level.
The model may still be safe; this abstraction was not tight enough for this input box.

## CROWN-Style Affine Bounds

CROWN-style passes keep affine upper and lower forms instead of only interval boxes. In other words,
the bound can say more than “this node lies between two numbers.” It can be “this node is bounded by a
linear expression over the input variables.” That preserves more correlation information.

CROWN still uses IBP intervals, because nonlinear relaxations need pre-activation ranges. Forward
CROWN stores affine lower and upper forms for nodes with respect to the chosen input node. Backward
CROWN starts from one scalar objective, such as `logit_0 - logit_1`, and propagates that objective
back to an input-box bound.

For ReLU, the affine relaxation depends on the pre-activation interval:

- if the interval is entirely nonnegative, ReLU is exactly the identity;
- if the interval is entirely nonpositive, ReLU is exactly zero;
- if the interval crosses zero, CROWN uses a sound linear envelope.

The example builds a context for the input node and runs CROWN after IBP:

```lean
let ctx : AffineCtx :=
  { inputId := compiled.inputId, inputDim := softmaxInDim }

let crown := runCROWN (α := α) compiled.graph ps ctx ibp
```

For a margin objective, the backward pass asks for a bound on one scalar expression, such as
`logit_0 - logit_1`. Instead of bounding every output independently, this lets the verifier push a
single objective backward through the graph:

```lean
let objV : Tensor α (.dim softmaxOutDim .scalar) :=
  NN.Tensor.tensorNDOfLenEq
    (α := α) [3] [cast 1.0, cast (-1.0), cast 0.0] (by rfl)

let obj : FlatVec α := { n := softmaxOutDim, v := objV }

match runCROWNBackwardObjective
    (α := α) compiled.graph ps ctx ibp compiled.outputId obj with
| none => IO.println "[CROWN-backward] no affine bounds"
| some objAff => IO.println s!"[CROWN-backward] objective dim = {objAff.outDim}"
```

The model, graph, bounds, and certificate checks all refer to the same node ids and tensor shapes.

## What Each Command Shows

Run the small TorchLean-native examples first:

```bash
lake exe verify -- torchlean-ibp --dtype float
lake exe verify -- torchlean-crown-ops --dtype float
lake exe verify -- torchlean-robustness --dtype float
lake exe verify -- torchlean-mlp-workflow
lake exe verify -- digits-train-certify --epochs=50 --eps=0.02 --max=100
lake exe verify -- margin-cert
lake exe verify -- vnncomp-mnistfc
lake exe verify -- camera-box3d-cert
```

`torchlean-ibp` is the smallest graph-bound check: compile a TorchLean model, attach an input
box, and propagate interval bounds to the output. `torchlean-crown-ops` uses the same graph style
but adds forward and backward CROWN-style affine passes over supported operations.
`torchlean-robustness` prints IBP, CROWN, and backward-CROWN certification booleans for a compact
robustness example. `torchlean-mlp-workflow` trains an MLP through the compiled backend and then
runs IBP/CROWN on the resulting graph-shaped artifact.

The remaining commands show artifact boundaries. `digits-train-certify` trains a small
sklearn-digits classifier with Python, exports weights and test examples, then immediately
recompiles and certifies those artifacts in Lean. `margin-cert` checks an exported margin JSON
artifact by recomputing the margin predicate. `vnncomp-mnistfc` exercises a compact
VNN-COMP-style fully connected MNIST network/property pair. `camera-box3d-cert` checks a camera
projection certificate for a 3D box artifact by recomputing the projected corners and the claimed
2D envelope.

Typical output from the native CROWN example includes softmax bounds, an MSE-loss bound, a margin
lower bound, and the backward objective bound. The exact numbers depend on dtype and runtime flags,
but the shape of the output should look like this:

```text
[IBP] logits lo = ...
[IBP] logits hi = ...
[CROWN] logits lo = ...
[CROWN] logits hi = ...
[CROWN-backward] objective bound = ...
```

Then check the bundled alpha-beta-CROWN-style leaf artifact:

```bash
lake exe verify -- abcrown-leaf
```

Run the compact LiRPA-style JSON fixtures:

```bash
lake exe verify -- lirpa-mlp
lake exe verify -- lirpa-cnn
lake exe verify -- lirpa-attention
lake exe verify -- lirpa-gru
lake exe verify -- lirpa-encoder
```

These commands are good checks when changing certificate parsing or bound-replay utilities. Each bundled
fixture names a small supported fragment, such as an MLP, convolutional head, attention softmax
block, GRU gate, or transformer encoder block. Lean checks the artifact it receives; the fixture is
evidence for the checker format and replay predicate, not a claim about every possible LiRPA
producer.

To run the fast non-interactive checker suite:

```bash
lake exe verify -- all
```

## External Artifacts

The alpha-beta-CROWN leaf checker is a structural checker for a declared leaf artifact. Vanilla
alpha-beta-CROWN does not emit TorchLean's JSON schema directly. The current path is: an external
verifier exposes or dumps terminal leaf data, TorchLean's exporter converts that data to
`abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1`, and Lean checks the represented part of the artifact: box nesting,
compatible array sizes, and the witness lower-bound test.

That last sentence is the trust boundary. The Lean checker accepts a specific schema and
checks the part of the terminal leaf represented in that schema. If the exporter lies about what the
external verifier produced, that is an exporter/provenance boundary. If the JSON satisfies the schema
and witness predicate, the Lean side check is local and reproducible.

```lean
def leafVerifiedAt (lb thr : Array Float) (witnessIdx : Nat) : Bool :=
  if witnessIdx < lb.size ∧ witnessIdx < thr.size then
    ltBool thr[witnessIdx]! lb[witnessIdx]!
  else
    false
```

The CLI entry point defaults to a small bundled artifact:

```bash
lake exe verify -- abcrown-leaf \
  NN/Examples/Verification/AbCrown/sample_abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1.json
```

To create that schema from a raw terminal-domain dump, use the TorchLean exporter:

```bash
python3 scripts/verification/abcrown/export_leaf_artifact.py \
  --input NN/Examples/Verification/AbCrown/example_raw_leaf_dump.json \
  --out _external/abcrown/leaf_artifact.json \
  --check
```

`ABCROWN_ARTIFACT_OUT` is the TorchLean side exporter hook. Use it from a small wrapper or
instrumented external verifier to write the schema that Lean checks. The external search still owns
the branch-and-bound run; TorchLean owns the exported artifact schema and the local witness
predicate replayed by the checker.

## How To Read A Verification Result

The native and external examples produce different kinds of evidence:

- IBP and CROWN commands compile a TorchLean model, attach an input box, propagate bounds over the
  supported graph operations, and report the resulting margin predicate.
- Margin certificates are replayable JSON claims: the file names a graph-shaped predicate and Lean
  recomputes the margin condition.
- LiRPA-style fixtures exercise small exported bound artifacts for supported network fragments.
  They are regression fixtures for the checker API and examples of the finite objects Lean can
  reload.
- α,β-CROWN-style leaf artifacts carry one terminal external-verifier claim into Lean. The checker
  validates the schema, box nesting, array sizes, and witness lower-bound comparison represented in
  that artifact.
- VNN-COMP-style examples show how a benchmark-shaped network/property pair can enter TorchLean
  while the benchmark runner remains an external producer.
- PINN, ODE, spline, and geometry examples use the same pattern outside image classification: a
  producer exports an artifact, and Lean recomputes the residual, enclosure, interval, or projection
  predicate being checked.

When a command succeeds, cite the object and predicate it checked. For example, say that Lean
accepted the `abcrown_leaf_artifact_v0_1` witness predicate for a particular JSON file, or that the
TorchLean graph IBP pass certified the reported margin on the stated input box. That phrasing is
more precise than saying only that a verifier ran.

A green command should always be read together with the object it checked. The question is:
which graph, which box, which scalar semantics, which certificate schema, and which theorem or
checker predicate did this command use?
