    <p>
      TorchLean is the first unified deep-learning framework built in Lean 4. It brings model
      construction, training, and formal reasoning into one library, so executable neural-network
      code and the mathematics used to study it do not become separate projects.
    </p>

    <p>
      You use it much like an ordinary ML library: define a model, load tensors, and train on CPU
      or GPU. Tensor shapes are part of the types, so incompatible layers and malformed operations
      are caught while the program is being written rather than during a training run.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once a model runs, its Lean definition can be lowered to the graph used by the runtime.
      Backends and accelerated kernels remain explicit, including the assumptions made at external
      library boundaries. The graph can then be studied with formally verified floating-point
      arithmetic, autograd theorems, robustness bounds, and certificate checkers.
