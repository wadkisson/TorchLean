      TorchLean formalizes neural network infrastructure in Lean 4, connecting typed tensor and
      layer specifications, runnable training examples, graph IR semantics, floating-point
      contracts, CUDA trust boundaries, and artifacts that Lean checkers can inspect.
    </p>

    <p class="lede">
      The goal is a practical bridge between modern ML workflows and formal reasoning: models can be
      executed, lowered, inspected, imported from PyTorch-style pipelines, and checked against
      explicit mathematical contracts.

## Where It Fits

TorchLean sits between the software people already use and the proof artifacts they want to trust.
The project is written in [Lean 4](https://lean-lang.org/) and uses a PyTorch-style surface where
that makes model code easier to read. For the Python ecosystem, see the official
[PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html); for Lean itself, start with the
[Lean documentation](https://lean-lang.org/documentation/).
