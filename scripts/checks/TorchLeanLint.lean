# TorchLeanLint

TorchLean linter driver.

This is wired into Lake as `lintDriver := "torchlean_lint"`, so you can run:

* `lake lint` locally
* (optionally) the same command in CI

Unlike mathlib’s `#lint`-heavy pipeline, TorchLean’s “lint” is primarily **repo policy**:
forbidden constructs (unverified proof stubs, unexpected axioms, native decision procedures, etc.),
whitespace hygiene, and consistent file headers. The goal is high-signal feedback while the library is
still evolving quickly.

Run a subprocess and fail if it exits nonzero.

This helper is used by the `torchlean_lint` executable entrypoint, so it must not be `private`
under `backward.privateInPublic := false`.
